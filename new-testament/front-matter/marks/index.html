	<h4>The signification or meaning of the numbers and marks used in this New Testament.</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The numbers in the text show, the numbers of verses in every chapter.
		<li>The numbers in the Arguments before every chapter, point to the same numbers of verses in the text, treating of the same matter.
		<li>The numbers in the beginning of the Annotations signify that the the Annotation is upon such a verse of the text.
		<li>The numbers joined to the citations of Scripture, if they be written thus, Gen. 4, 16, the first is the chapter, the second is the verse. If thus, Gen. 4. 16. both are the chapters. If thus, Gen. 4, 16. 17. 18. the first is the chapter, all the rest the verses. If thus, Gen. 4, 16. 5, 7. it signifieth, chap. 4. vers. 16 and chap. 5. vers. 7.
		<li>″ This mark in the text signifieth, that there is an Annotation upon that word or words which follow the said mark.
		<li>* This star in the text, or in the Annotations, signifieth the allegations cited over-againft the same in the margent, or some other thing answering therunto.
		<li>′ This mark showeth another reading in the margent. And if there be nothing in the margent, it signifieth that those words are not in some copies.
		<li>∷ a b &amp; c. These notes in the text, refer us to the same notes in the margent.
		<li>✠ This mark signifieth the ending of Ghospels and Epistles: Whereof there is, a table at the end of this book. Their beginning is known by the margent, where directly at the beginning of them, is set, The Ghospel, or, The Epistle upon such a day. And if it could not be so set directly (because of other marginal notes) then some letter is the mark of their beginning.
