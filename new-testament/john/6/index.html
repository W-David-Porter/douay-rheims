	<p><em>Having with five loaves fed five thousand (16)&nbsp;(walking also the night after upon the sea) (22)&nbsp;on the morrow the people thereupon resorting unto him, (27)&nbsp;he preacheth unto them of the Bread which he will give: telling them that he is come from Heaven, and therefore able to give such bread as can quicken the world, even his own flesh: and that all his Elect shall believe as much. (60)&nbsp;Many notwithstanding do murmur at this doctrine yea and become apostates, though he tell them that they shall see by his Ascension into Heaven, that he is descended from Heaven. But the Twelve stick unto him, Peter in all their names confessing that he is God Omnipotent. (70)&nbsp;Among which twelve (yet that no man be scandalised) he signifieth that he foreknoweth which will become a traitor: as among the foresaid, which would become apostates.</em>

	<p>Jesus went beyond the sea of Galilee, which is of Tiberias. <sup>2</sup>and a great multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he did upon those that were sick. <sup>3</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his Disciples. <sup>4</sup>And the Pasch was at hand, the festival day of the Jews. <sup>5</sup>When <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore had lifted up his eyes, and saw that a very great multitude cometh to him, he saith to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread: that these may eat? <sup>6</sup>And this he said, tempting him. For himself knew what he would do. <sup>7</sup>Philip answered him: Two hundred penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every man may take a little piece. <sup>8</sup>One of his Disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, saith to him: <sup>9</sup>There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves, and two fishes; but what are these among so many? <sup>10</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore saith: Make the men to sit down. And there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand. <sup>11</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to them that sat. In like manner also of the fishes as much as they would. <sup>12</sup>And after they were filled, he said to his Disciples: Gather the fragments that are remaining, lest they be lost. <sup>13</sup>They gathered therefore, and filled twelve baskets with fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained to them that had eaten. <sup>14</sup>Those men therefore when they had seen what a sign <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> had done, said: That this is the Prophet indeed that is to come into the world. <sup>15</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore when he knew that they would come to take him, and make him king, * he fled again into the mountain himself alone.

<p><sup>16</sup>And when even was come, his Disciples went down to the sea. <sup>17</sup>And when they were gone up into the ship, they came beyond the sea into Capharnaum. And now it was dark and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> was not come unto them <sup>18</sup>And the sea arose, by reason of a great wind that blew. <sup>19</sup>When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty
