	<p><em>Having with five loaves fed five thousand (16)&nbsp;(walking also the night after upon the sea) (22)&nbsp;on the morrow the people thereupon resorting unto him, (27)&nbsp;he preacheth unto them of the Bread which he will give: telling them that he is come from Heaven, and therefore able to give such bread as can quicken the world, even his own flesh: and that all his Elect shall believe as much. (60)&nbsp;Many notwithstanding do murmur at this doctrine yea and become apostates, though he tell them that they shall see by his Ascension into Heaven, that he is descended from Heaven. But the Twelve stick unto him, Peter in all their names confessing that he is God Omnipotent. (70)&nbsp;Among which twelve (yet that no man be scandalised) he signifieth that he foreknoweth which will become a traitor: as among the foresaid, which would become apostates.</em>

<div class=verse>
	<p>Jesus went beyond the sea of Galilee, which is of Tiberias. <sup>2</sup>and a great multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he did upon those that were sick. <sup>3</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his Disciples. <sup>4</sup>And the Pasch was at hand, the festival day of the Jews. <sup>5</sup>When <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore had lifted up his eyes, and saw that a very great multitude cometh to him, he saith to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread: that these may eat? <sup>6</sup>And this he said, tempting him. For himself knew what he would do. <sup>7</sup>Philip answered him: Two hundred penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every man may take a little piece. <sup>8</sup>One of his Disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, saith to him: <sup>9</sup>There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves, and two fishes; but what are these among so many? <sup>10</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore saith: Make the men to sit down. And there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand. <sup>11</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to them that sat. In like manner also of the fishes as much as they would. <sup>12</sup>And after they were filled, he said to his Disciples: Gather the fragments that are remaining, lest they be lost. <sup>13</sup>They gathered therefore, and filled twelve baskets with fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained to them that had eaten. <sup>14</sup>Those men therefore when they had seen what a sign <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> had done, said: That this is the Prophet indeed that is to come into the world. <sup>15</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore when he knew that they would come to take him, and make him king, * he fled again into the mountain himself alone.

	<p><sup>16</sup>And when even was come, his Disciples went down to the sea. <sup>17</sup>And when they were gone up into the ship, they came beyond the sea into Capharnaum. And now it was dark and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> was not come unto them <sup>18</sup>And the sea arose, by reason of a great wind that blew. <sup>19</sup>When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> walking upon the sea, and to draw nigh to the ship, and they feared. <sup>20</sup>But he saith to them: It is I, fear not. <sup>21</sup>They would therefore have taken him into the ship: and forthwith the ship was at the land to which they went.</p>

	<p><sup>22</sup>The next day, the multitude that stood beyond the sea, saw that there was no other boat there but one, and that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> had not entered into the boat with his Disciples, but that his Disciples only were departed. <sup>23</sup>But other boats came in from Tiberias beside the place where they had eaten the bread, our Lord <sup><a id="jn6-fn-a-t" href="#jn6-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> giving thanks. <sup>24</sup>When therefore the multitude saw that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> was not there, nor his Disciples, they went up into the boats, and came to Capharnaum seeking <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>. <sup>25</sup>And when they had found him beyond the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when camest thou hither? <sup>26</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered them, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, you seek me not because you have seen signs, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled. <sup>27</sup> <a id="jn6-anno-27-t" href="#jn6-anno-27" class="annotation">•</a> Work not the meat that perisheth, but that endureth unto life everlasting, which the Son of man will give you. For him the Father, God, hath signed. <sup>28</sup>They said therefore unto him: What shall we do that we may work the works of God? <sup>29</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to them: This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he hath sent. <sup>30</sup>They said therefore to him: What sign therefore doest thou, that we may see, and may believe thee? What workest thou?</p>

	<p><sup>31</sup>Our * Fathers did eat Manna in the desert, as it is written, <em>Bread from Heaven he gave them to eat</em>. <sup>32</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore said to them, <sup><a id="jn6-fn-b-t" href="#jn6-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> Amen, amen I say to you: Moyses gave you not the bread from Heaven, but my Father giveth you <a id="jn6-anno-32-t" href="#jn6-anno-32" class="annotation">•</a> the true bread from Heaven. <sup>33</sup>For the bread of God it is that descendeth from Heaven, and giveth life to the world. <sup>34</sup>They said therefore unto him: Lord, give us always this bread. <sup>35</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me, shall not hunger; and he that believeth in me, shall never thirst. <sup>36</sup>But I said to you that both you have seen me and you believe not. <sup>37</sup>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will not cast forth. <sup>38</sup>Because I descended from Heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. <sup>39</sup>For this is the will of him that sent me, the Father; that all that he hath given me I lose not thereof, but raise it in the last day. <sup>40</sup>And this is the will of my Father that sent me; that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth in him, have life everlasting, and I will raise him in the last day.</p>
	
	<p><sup>41</sup>The Jews therefore murmured at him, because he had said: I am the bread which descended from Heaven; <sup>42</sup>and they said: Is not this <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then saith he, That I descended from Heaven? <sup>43</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore answered and said to them: Murmur not one to another; <sup>44</sup>no man can come to me, unless the Father that sent me, <a id="jn6-anno-44-t" href="#jn6-anno-44" class="annotation">•</a> draw him, and I will raise him up in the last day. <sup>45</sup>It is written in the Prophets, <em>And all shall be docible of God</em>. Every one that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh to me. <sup>46</sup>Not that any man hath seen the Father, but he which is of God; this hath seen the Father. <sup>47</sup>Amen, amen I say to you, he that believeth in me, hath life everlasting.
