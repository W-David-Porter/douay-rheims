  <p>Again in the Temple (absolving an advoutress after his merciful manner, and yet withal declaring against his enemies that he is not a favourer of sin, no more than Moyses) (12)&nbsp;he teacheth openly, and is not for all that apprehended: telling them both of his Godhead, (21)&nbsp;and of their reprobation, (28)&nbsp;of his exaltation also by their Crucifying of him: (31)&nbsp;exhorting the believers to persevere, (33)&nbsp;and showing them that seek his death, that they are neither free, (39)&nbsp;nor of Abraham, (41)&nbsp;nor of God, (44)&nbsp;but of the Devil. (45)&nbsp;But that himself is of God, (52)&nbsp;and greater and ancienter than Abraham. (59)&nbsp;For the which they go about to stone him, but in vain.

	<p>AND <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> went into the Mount-olivet: <sup>2</sup>and early in the morning again he came into the Temple, and the people came to him, and sitting he taught them.
  <p><sup>3</sup>And the Scribes and Pharisees bring a woman taken in advoutry: and they did set her in the midst, <sup>4</sup>and said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in advoutry. <sup>5</sup>And * in the law Moyses commanded us to stone such. What sayest thou therefore? <sup>6</sup>And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> bowing himself down, with his finger wrote in the earth. <sup>7</sup>When they therefore continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: <sup><a id="jn8-fn-a-t" href="#jn8-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> He that is without sin of you, let him first throw the stone at her. <sup>8</sup>And again bowing himself, he wrote in the earth. <sup>9</sup>And they hearing, went out one by one, beginning at the Seniors: and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst. <sup>10</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? hath no man condemned thee? <sup>11</sup>Who said: No man, Lord. And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said: <sup><a id="jn8-fn-b-t" href="#jn8-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.

  <p><sup>12</sup>Again therefore <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life. <sup>13</sup>The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself; thy testimony is not true. <sup>14</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to them: Although I do give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: because I know whence I came, and whither I go; but you know not whence I come, or whither I go. <sup>15</sup>You judge according to the flesh; I do not judge any man. <sup>16</sup>And if I do judge, my judgement is true; because I am not alone, but I and he that sent me, the Father. <sup>17</sup>And in your law it is written, that * the testimony of two men is true. <sup>18</sup>I am he that give testimony of myself; and he that sent me, the Father, giveth testimony of me. <sup>19</sup>They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father. If you did know me, perhaps you might know my Father also. <sup>20</sup>These words <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> spoke in the Treasury, teaching in the Temple, and no man apprehended him, because his hour was not yet come.
  
	<p><sup>21</sup>Again therefore <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you can not come. <sup>22</sup>The Jews therefore said: Why, will he kill himself, because he saith, Whither I go, you can not come? <sup>23</sup>And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world. <sup>24</sup>Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin. <sup>25</sup>They said therefore to him: Who art thou? <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: <sup><a id="jn8-fn-c-t" href="#jn8-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> The beginning who also speak to you. <sup>26</sup>Many things I have to speak and judge of you. But he that sent me, is true; and what I have heard of him, these things I speak in the world. <sup>27</sup>And they knew not that he said to them that his Father was God. <sup>28</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore said to them: When you shall have exalted the Son of man, then you shall know that I am he, and of myself I do nothing, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak; <sup>29</sup>and he that sent me, is with me: and he hath not left me alone, because the things that please him I do always. <sup>30</sup>When he spoke these things, many believed in him.

	<p><sup>31</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore said to them that believed him, the Jews: If you <sup><a id="jn8-fn-d-t" href="#jn8-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> abide in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed. <sup>32</sup>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. <sup>33</sup>They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we never served any man; how sayest thou, You shall be free? <sup>34</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered them: <a id="jn8-anno-34-t" href="#jn8-anno-34" class="annotation">•</a> Amen, amen I say to you; that * everyone which committeth sin, is the servant of sin. <sup>35</sup>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever; the son abideth for ever. <sup>36</sup>If therefore the Son make you free, you shall be <sup><a id="jn8-fn-e-t" href="#jn8-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> free indeed. <sup>37</sup>I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word taketh not in you. <sup>38</sup>I speak that which I have seen with my Father; and you do the things that you have seen with your Father. <sup>39</sup>They answered, and said to him: Our Father is Abraham. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, <sup><a id="jn8-fn-f-t" href="#jn8-fn-f" class=afn>[f]</a></sup> do the works of Abraham. <sup>40</sup>But now, you seek to kill me, a man that has spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This did not Abraham. <sup>41</sup>You do the works of your Father. They said therefore to him: We were not born of fornication. We have one Father, God. <sup>42</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore said to them: If God were your Father; verily you would love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me. <sup>43</sup>Why do you not know my speech? Because you can not hear my word. <sup>44</sup>You are of your father the Devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a <sup><a id="jn8-fn-g-t" href="#jn8-fn-g" class=afn>[g]</a></sup> man-killer from the beginning, and he stood not in the verity; because verity is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, because he is a liar, and the father thereof. <sup>45</sup>But because I say the verity, you believe me not. <sup>46</sup>Which of you shall argue me of sin? If I say the verity, why do you not believe me? <sup>47</sup>He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear not, because you are not of God. <sup>48</sup>The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a Devil? <sup>49</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered: <sup><a id="jn8-fn-h-t" href="#jn8-fn-h" class=afn>[h]</a></sup> I have no Devil; but I do honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me. <sup>50</sup>But I seek not mine own glory. There is that seeketh and judgeth.

	<p><sup>51</sup>Amen, amen I say to you; If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever. <sup>52</sup>The Jews therefore said: Now we have known that thou hast a Devil. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets; and thou sayest, If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever. <sup>53</sup>Why, art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the Prophets are dead. Whom doest thou make thy self? <sup>54</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered: If I do glorify my self, my glory is nothing. It is my father that glorifieth me, whom you say that he is your God. <sup>55</sup>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word. <sup>56</sup>Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: and he saw, and was glad. <sup>57</sup>The Jews therefore said to him: Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham? <sup>58</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before that Abraham was made I am. <sup>59</sup>They took stones therefore to cast at him. But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> hid himself, and went out of the temple.
