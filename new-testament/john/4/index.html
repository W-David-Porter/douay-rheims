	<p><em>Leaving Jewry because of the Pharisees, in the way to Galilee he talketh with a Samaritan woman, telling her that he will give water of everlasting life, (16)&nbsp;showing himself to know men’s secrets, (19)&nbsp;preferring the Jews’ religion before the Samaritans, but ours (the Christian Catholic religion) before them both, (25)&nbsp;and uttering unto her that he is Christ. (28)&nbsp;Which by her testimony and his preaching very many Samaritans do believe: he in the meantime foretelling his Disciples, of the harvest he will send them into. (45)&nbsp;The Galileans also receive him, where again he worketh his second miracle.</em>

	<p>WHEN <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore understood that the Pharisees heard that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> maketh more Disciples, and baptizeth, than John, <sup>2</sup>(howbeit <sup><a id="jn4-fn-a-t" href="#jn4-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> did not baptize, but his Disciples) <sup>3</sup>he left Jewry, and went again into Galilee. <sup>4</sup>And he had of necessity to pass through Samaria. <sup>5</sup>He cometh therefore into a city of Samaria which is called Sichar; * beside the Manor that Jacob gave to Joseph his son. <sup>6</sup>And there was there the fountain of Jacob. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore wearied of his journey, sat so upon the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.

	<p><sup>7</sup>There cometh <sup><a id="jn4-fn-b-t" href="#jn4-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> a woman of Samaria to draw water. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Give me to drink. <sup>8</sup>For his Disciples were gone into the city, to buy meats. <sup>9</sup>Therefore that Samaritan woman saith to him: How doest thou being a Jew, ask of me to drink, which am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews <sup><a id="jn4-fn-c-t" href="#jn4-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> do not communicate with the Samaritans. <sup>10</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee the <sup><a id="jn4-fn-d-t" href="#jn4-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> living water. <sup>11</sup>The woman saith to him: Sir, neither hast thou wherein to draw, and the well is deep; whence hast thou living water? <sup>12</sup>Art thou greater than our Father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank of it, and his children, and his cattle? <sup>13</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to her: Every one that drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever, <sup>14</sup>but the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto life everlasting. <sup>15</sup>The woman saith to him: Lord give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</p>

	<p><sup>16</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither. <sup>17</sup>The woman answered and said: I have no husband. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Thou hast said well, that I have no husband. <sup>18</sup>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.</p>
	
	<p><sup>19</sup>The woman saith to him: Lord, I perceive that thou art a Prophet. <sup>20</sup> <a id="jn4-anno-20-t" href="#jn4-anno-20" class="annotation">•</a> Our fathers adored in this mountain, and you say * that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore. <sup>21</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Woman believe me, that the hour shall come, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem adore the Father. <sup>22</sup> * You adore that you know not: we adore that we know, for salvation is of the Jews. <sup>23</sup>But the hour cometh, and now it is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father <a id="jn4-anno-23-t" href="#jn4-anno-23" class="annotation">•</a> in spirit and verity. For the Father also seeketh such, to adore him. <sup>24</sup>God is a Spirit, and they that adore him, must adore in spirit and verity. <sup>25</sup>The woman saith to him: I know that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Messias</span> cometh, (which is called <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>) therefore when he cometh, he will show us all things. <sup>26</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: I am he, that speak with thee.</p>
	
	<p><sup>27</sup>And incontinent his Disciples came; and they marvelled that he talked with a woman. No man for all that said: What seekest thou, or why talkest thou with her?</p>
	
	<p><sup>28</sup>The woman therefore left her water-pot: and she went into the city, and saith to those men: <sup>29</sup>Come, and see a man that hath told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>? <sup>30</sup>They went forth therefore out of the city, and came to him.</p>
	
	<p><sup>31</sup>In the meantime the Disciples desired him, saying: Rabbi eat. <sup>32</sup>But he said to them: I have meat to eat which you know not. <sup>33</sup>The Disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him for to eat? <sup>34</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, to perfect his work. <sup>35</sup>Do not you say that yet there are four months, and harvest cometh? Behold I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the Countries, that they are white already to harvest. <sup>36</sup>And he that reapeth, receiveth hire, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting; that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together. <sup>37</sup>For in this is the saying true; that it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth. <sup>38</sup>I have sent you to reap that which you laboured not; others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.</p>
	
	<p><sup>39</sup>And of that city many believed in him of the Samaritans, for the word of the <sup><a id="jn4-fn-e-t" href="#jn4-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> woman giving testimony: that he told me all things whatsoever I have done. <sup>40</sup>Therefore when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired him that he would tarry there. And he tarried there two days. <sup>41</sup>And many more believed for his own word. <sup>42</sup>And they said to the woman: That now not for thy saying do we believe; for ourselves have heard, and do know that this is the Saviour of the world indeed.

	<p><sup>43</sup>And after the two days he departed thence; and went into Galilee. <sup>44</sup>For <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> himself gave testimony that a Prophet hath not honour in his own country. <sup>45</sup>Therefore * when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, whereas they had seen all things that he had done at Jerusalem in the festival day; for themselves also came to the festival day.

	<p><sup>46</sup>He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, * where he made water wine. And there was a certain Lord whose son was sick at Capharnaum. <sup>47</sup>He having heard that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> came from Jewry into Galilee, went to him, and desired him that he would come down and heal his son, for he began to die. <sup>48</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not. <sup>49</sup>The Lord saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die. <sup>50</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to him: Go, thy son liveth. The man believed the word that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to him, and went. <sup>51</sup>And as he was now going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying: That his son lived. <sup>52</sup>He asked therefore of them the hour, wherein he was amended. And they said to him: That yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. <sup>53</sup>The father therefore knew that it was in the same hour wherein <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: Thy son liveth, and himself believed and his whole house. <sup>54</sup>This again the * second sign did <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, when he was come from Jewry into Galilee.

For other offices of Religion might be done in any place. The Samaritans to defend their adoring in Garizim, pretended their worshipping there to be more ancient than the Jews in Hierusalem, referring it to Jacob: whereas indeed that Patriarch adoring there before the Temple was appointed, or the Law given, made nothing for their Schism: which was begun by Manasses a fugitive Priest, only to hold his unlawful wife thereby, and to obtain Superiority in Schism: which he could not do in the unity of his brethren; long after the Temple of Jerusalem from which the revolt was made. Therefore Christ giveth sentence for the Jews and the Temple of Hierusalem, affirming that they had a good ground thereof, but the Samaritans none at all.
		<p>Josephus also recordeth how the Samaritans demanded of Alexander the Great, the like privileges and immunities as he had granted to the high Priest and Temple of Hierusalem, pretending their Temple to be as great and as worthy, and themselves to be Jews as the other, and to worship the same God. But their Schismatical hypocrisy was easily spied and dismissed with nothing. Another time the Jews and Samaritans (as the same writer testifieth) made a great stir in Alexandria about the truth and antiquity of the Schismatical Temple and service in Garizim, and the other true Temple of Salomon: insomuch that the matter was put to arbitrement by Ptolomaeus the King’s commandment, only to try whether of the two was first. And the Schismatics (as their custom is) <em>per saltum</em> can make their Church or service as old as they list, referring it to the Patriarchs, as our Schismatics do now to Christ and the Apostles. But
