	<p><em>Leaving Jewry because of the Pharisees, in the way to Galilee he talketh with a Samaritan woman, telling her that he will give water of everlasting life, (16)&nbsp;showing himself to know men’s secrets, (19)&nbsp;preferring the Jews’ religion before the Samaritans, but ours (the Christian Catholic religion) before them both, (25)&nbsp;and uttering unto her that he is Christ. (28)&nbsp;Which by her testimony and his preaching very many Samaritans do believe: he in the meantime foretelling his Disciples, of the harvest he will send them into. (45)&nbsp;The Galileans also receive him, where again he worketh his second miracle.</em>

	<p>WHEN <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore understood that the Pharisees heard that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> maketh more Disciples, and baptizeth, than John, <sup>2</sup>(howbeit <sup><a id="jn4-fn-a-t" href="#jn4-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> did not baptize, but his Disciples) <sup>3</sup>he left Jewry, and went again into Galilee. <sup>4</sup>And he had of necessity to pass through Samaria. <sup>5</sup>He cometh therefore into a city of Samaria which is called Sichar; * beside the Manor that Jacob gave to Joseph his son. <sup>6</sup>And there was there the fountain of Jacob. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore wearied of his journey, sat so upon the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.

	<p><sup>7</sup>There cometh <sup><a id="jn4-fn-b-t" href="#jn4-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> a woman of Samaria to draw water. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Give me to drink. <sup>8</sup>For his Disciples were gone into the city, to buy meats. <sup>9</sup>Therefore that Samaritan woman saith to him: How doest thou being a Jew, ask of me to drink, which am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews <sup><a id="jn4-fn-c-t" href="#jn4-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> do not communicate with the Samaritans. <sup>10</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee the <sup><a id="jn4-fn-d-t" href="#jn4-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> living water. <sup>11</sup>The woman saith to him: Sir, neither hast thou wherein to draw, and the well is deep; whence hast thou living water? <sup>12</sup>Art thou greater than our Father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank of it, and his children, and his cattle? <sup>13</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to her: Every one that drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever, <sup>14</sup>but the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto life everlasting. <sup>15</sup>The woman saith to him: Lord give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</p>

	<p><sup>16</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither. <sup>17</sup>The woman answered and said: I have no husband. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Thou hast said well, that I have no husband. <sup>18</sup>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.</p>
	
	<p><sup>19</sup>The woman saith to him: Lord, I perceive that thou art a Prophet. <sup>20</sup> <a id="jn4-anno-20-t" href="#jn4-anno-20" class="annotation">•</a> Our fathers adored in this mountain, and you say * that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore. <sup>21</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Woman believe me, that the hour shall come, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem adore the Father. <sup>22</sup> * You adore that you know not: we adore that we know, for salvation is of the Jews. <sup>23</sup>But the hour cometh, and now it is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father <a id="jn4-anno-23-t" href="#jn4-anno-23" class="annotation">•</a> in spirit and verity. For the Father also seeketh such, to adore him. <sup>24</sup>God is a Spirit, and they that adore him, must adore in spirit and verity. <sup>25</sup>The woman saith to him: I know that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Messias</span> cometh, (which is called <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>) therefore when he cometh, he will show us all things. <sup>26</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: I am he, that speak with thee.</p>
	
	<p><sup>27</sup>And incontinent his Disciples came; and they marvelled that he talked with a woman. No man for all that said: What seekest thou, or why talkest thou with her?</p>
	
	<p><sup>28</sup>The woman therefore left her water-pot: and she went into the city, and saith to those men: <sup>29</sup>Come, and see a man that hath told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>? <sup>30</sup>They went forth therefore out of the city, and came to him.</p>
	
	<p><sup>31</sup>In the meantime the Disciples desired him, saying: Rabbi eat. <sup>32</sup>But he said to them: I have meat to eat which you know not. <sup>33</sup>The Disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him for to eat? <sup>34</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, to perfect his work. <sup>35</sup>Do not you say that yet there are four months, and harvest cometh? Behold I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the Countries, that they are white already to harvest. <sup>36</sup>And he that reapeth, receiveth hire, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting; that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together. <sup>37</sup>For in this is the saying true; that it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth. <sup>38</sup>I have sent you to reap that which you laboured not; others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.</p>
	
	<p><sup>39</sup>And of that city many believed in him of the Samaritans, for the word of the <sup><a id="jn4-fn-e-t" href="#jn4-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> woman giving testimony: that he told me all things whatsoever I have done. <sup>40</sup>Therefore when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired him that he would tarry there. And he tarried
