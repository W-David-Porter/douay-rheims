	<p><em>Leaving Jewry because of the Pharisees, in the way to Galilee he talketh with a Samaritan woman, telling her that he will give water of everlasting life, (16)&nbsp;showing himself to know men’s secrets, (19)&nbsp;preferring the Jews’ religion before the Samaritans, but ours (the Christian Catholic religion) before them both, (25)&nbsp;and uttering unto her that he is Christ. (28)&nbsp;Which by her testimony and his preaching very many Samaritans do believe: he in the meantime foretelling his Disciples, of the harvest he will send them into. (45)&nbsp;The Galileans also receive him, where again he worketh his second miracle.</em>

	<p>WHEN <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore understood that the Pharisees heard that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> maketh more Disciples, and baptizeth, than John, <sup>2</sup>(howbeit <sup><a id="jn4-fn-a-t" href="#jn4-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> did not baptize, but his Disciples) <sup>3</sup>he left Jewry, and went again into Galilee. <sup>4</sup>And he had of necessity to pass through Samaria. <sup>5</sup>He cometh therefore into a city of Samaria which is called Sichar; * beside the Manor that Jacob gave to Joseph his son. <sup>6</sup>And there was there the fountain of Jacob. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore wearied of his journey, sat so upon the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.

	<p><sup>7</sup>There cometh <sup><a id="jn4-fn-b-t" href="#jn4-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> a woman of Samaria to draw water. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to her: Give me to drink. <sup>8</sup>For his Disciples were gone into the city, to buy meats. <sup>9</sup>Therefore that Samaritan woman saith to him: How doest thou being a Jew, ask of me to drink, which am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews <sup><a id="jn4-fn-c-t" href="#jn4-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> do not communicate with the Samaritans. <sup>10</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee the <sup><a id="jn4-fn-d-t" href="#jn4-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> living water. <sup>11</sup>The woman saith to him: Sir, neither hast thou wherein to draw, and the well is deep; whence hast thou living water? <sup>12</sup>Art thou greater than our Father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank of it, and his children, and his cattle? <sup>13</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered,
