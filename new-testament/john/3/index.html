	<p><em>He teacheth Nicodemus, that to come to the Kingdom of God, Baptism is necessary, as being our Regeneration. (10)&nbsp;Which point Nicodemus as then not understanding, (11)&nbsp;he showeth that they must believe him, and what good cause there is for them so to do. (23)&nbsp;After this he also baptized, and John likewise at the same time. (25)&nbsp;Whereupon a question being moved, whether Baptism is better, (27)&nbsp;John answereth it by saying, that he is so far inferior to Christ, as a mere man to God most high.</em></p>

	<p>AND there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a prince of the Jews. <sup>2</sup>This man came to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come from God a Master; for no man can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him. <sup>3</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to him: Amen, Amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he can not see the Kingdom of God. <sup>4</sup>Nicodemus said to him: How can a man be born, when he is old? can he enter into his mother’s womb again and be born? <sup>5</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered: Amen, Amen I say to thee, unless a man be <a id="jn3-anno-5-t" href="#jn3-anno-5" class="annotation">•</a> born again of water and the Spirit, he can not enter into the Kingdom of God. <sup>6</sup>That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit. <sup>7</sup>Marvel not, that I said to thee, You must be born again. <sup>8</sup>The Spirit breatheth where <sup><a id="jn3-fn-a-t" href="#jn3-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> he will; and thou hearest his voice, but thou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit. <sup>9</sup>Nicodemus answered, and said to him: How can these things be done? <sup>10</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to him: Thou art a Master in Israel, and art thou ignorant of these things? <sup>11</sup>Amen, Amen I say to thee, that we speak that which we know, and that which we have seen we testify, and our testimony you receive not. <sup>12</sup>If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not; how if I shall speak to you heavenly things, will you believe? <sup>13</sup>And no man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that descended from Heaven, the Son of man which is in Heaven. <sup>14</sup>And as * Moyses exalted the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be exalted; <sup>15</sup>that every one which believeth in him, perish not, but may have life everlasting. <sup>16</sup>For so God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son; that every one that believeth in him, perish not, but may have life everlasting. <sup>17</sup>For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him. <sup>18</sup>He that believeth in him, is not judged. But he that doth not believe, <a id="jn3-anno-18-t" href="#jn3-anno-18" class="annotation">•</a> is already judged; because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of
