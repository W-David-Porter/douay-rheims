	<p><em>He teacheth Nicodemus, that to come to the Kingdom of God, Baptism is necessary, as being our Regeneration. (10)&nbsp;Which point Nicodemus as then not understanding, (11)&nbsp;he showeth that they must believe him, and what good cause there is for them so to do. (23)&nbsp;After this he also baptized, and John likewise at the same time. (25)&nbsp;Whereupon a question being moved, whether Baptism is better, (27)&nbsp;John answereth it by saying, that he is so far inferior to Christ, as a mere man to God most high.</em></p>

	<p>AND there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a prince of the Jews. <sup>2</sup>This man came to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come from God a Master; for no man can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him. <sup>3</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to him: Amen, Amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he can not see the Kingdom of God. <sup>4</sup>Nicodemus said to him: How can a man be born, when he is old? can he enter into his mother’s womb again and be born? <sup>5</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered: Amen, Amen I say to thee, unless a man be <a id="jn3-anno-5-t" href="#jn3-anno-5" class="annotation">•</a> born again of water and the Spirit, he can not enter into the Kingdom of God. <sup>6</sup>That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit. <sup>7</sup>Marvel not, that I said to thee, You must be born again. <sup>8</sup>The Spirit breatheth where <sup><a id="jn3-fn-a-t" href="#jn3-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> he will; and thou hearest his voice, but thou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit. <sup>9</sup>Nicodemus answered, and said to him: How can these things be done? <sup>10</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered, and said to him: Thou art a Master in Israel, and art thou ignorant of these things? <sup>11</sup>Amen, Amen I say to thee, that we speak that which we know, and that which we have seen we testify, and our testimony you receive not. <sup>12</sup>If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not; how if I shall speak to you heavenly things, will you believe? <sup>13</sup>And no man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that descended from Heaven, the Son of man which is in Heaven. <sup>14</sup>And as * Moyses exalted the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be exalted; <sup>15</sup>that every one which believeth in him, perish not, but may have life everlasting. <sup>16</sup>For so God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son; that every one that believeth in him, perish not, but may have life everlasting. <sup>17</sup>For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him. <sup>18</sup>He that believeth in him, is not judged. But he that doth not believe, <a id="jn3-anno-18-t" href="#jn3-anno-18" class="annotation">•</a> is already judged; because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. <sup>19</sup>And this is the judgement: because the light is come into the world, and men have loved the darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil. <sup>20</sup>For every one that doeth ill, hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be controlled. <sup>21</sup>But he that doeth verity, cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they were done in God.
</p>
	<p><sup>22</sup>After these things <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> came and his Disciples into the country of Jewry: and there he abode with them, and baptized. <sup>23</sup>And John also was baptizing in Aenon beside Salim; because there was much water there, and they came, and were baptized. <sup>24</sup>For John was not yet cast into prison. <sup>25</sup>And there rose a question of John’s Disciples with the Jews concerning purification. <sup>26</sup>And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom * thou didst give testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all come to him. <sup>27</sup>John answered and said: A man can not receive any thing, unless it be given him from Heaven. <sup>28</sup>Your selves do bear me witness, * that I said, I am not <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>; but that I am sent before him. <sup>29</sup>He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy for the voice of the bridegroom. This my joy therefore is filled. <sup>30</sup>He must increase, and I diminish. <sup>31</sup> <a id="jn3-anno-31-t" href="#jn3-anno-31" class="annotation">•</a> He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from Heaven, is above all. <sup>32</sup>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and his testimony no men receiveth. <sup>33</sup>He that hath received his testimony, hath signed that God is true. <sup>34</sup>For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God. For God doth not give the spirit by measure. <sup>35</sup>The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things in his hand. <sup>36</sup>He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting: but he that is incredulous to the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God remaineth upon him.</p>

	<p><a id="jn3-anno-5" href="#jn3-anno-5-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 5. <em>Born again of water.</em>) As no man can enter into this world not have his life and being in the same, except he be born of his carnal parents: no more can a man enter into the life and state of grace which is in Christ, or attain to life everlasting, unless he be born and baptized of water and the Holy Ghost. Whereby we see first, this Sacrament to be called our regeneration or second birth, in respect of our natural and carnal which was before. Secondly, that this Sacrament consisteth of an external element of water, and internal virtue of the Holy Spirit: wherein it excelleth John’s Baptism, which had the external element, but not the spiritual grace. Thirdly, that no man can enter into the Kingdom of God, not into the fellowship of Holy Church, without it. Whereby the * Pelagians, and Calvinists be condemned, that promise life everlasting to young children that die without Baptism, and all other that think only faith to serve, or the external element of water superfluous or not necessary: our Saviour’s words being plain and general. Though in this case, God which hath not bound his grace, in respect of his own freedom, to any Sacrament, may and doth accept them as baptized, which either are martyred before they could be baptized, or else depart this life with vow and desire to have that Sacrament, but by some remediless necessity could not obtain it. Lastly, it is proved that this Sacrament giveth grace <em>ex opere operato</em>, that is, of the work itself
