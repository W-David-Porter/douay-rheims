	<p>The Jews (of Hierusalem) seeking his death, he walketh in Galilee: where he signifieth to his brethren, that not in this feast Scenopegia, but in another (to wit, Pasch following) the Jews should kill him: that is, not when they would, but when he will. (10)&nbsp;Insomuch that at this feast he teacheth openly in the Temple, and converteth many, (14)&nbsp;both in the middle day (37)&nbsp;and the last day thereof, without any hurt, though also the Rulers send to apprehend him.

<div class=verse>
	<p>AFTER these things <span style=" font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> walked ‘into Galilee’, for he would not walk </em>‘into Jewry’: because the Jews sought to kill him. <sup>2</sup>And the festival day of the Jews, * <sup><a id="jn7-fn-a-t" href="#jn7-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> Scenopegia, was at hand. <sup>3</sup>And his Brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Jewry; that thy Disciples also may see thy works which thou doest. <sup>4</sup>For no man doth any thing in secret, and seeketh himself to be in public. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world. <sup>5</sup>For neither did his Brethren believe in him. <sup>6</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore saith to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready. <sup>7</sup>The world can not hate you. but me it hateth; because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil. <sup>8</sup>Go you up to this festival day: ‘I go not up’ to this festival day; because my time is not yet accomplished.

<p><sup>9</sup>When he had said these things, himself tarried in Galilee. <sup>10</sup>But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the festival day, not openly, but as it were in secret. <sup>11</sup>The Jews therefore sought him in the festival day, and said: Where is he? <sup>12</sup>And there was much murmuring in the multitude of him. For certain said: That he is good. And others said: No, but he seduceth the multitudes. <sup>13</sup>Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.

<p><sup>14</sup>And when the festivity was now half done, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> went up into the Temple, and taught. <sup>15</sup>And the Jews marvelled, saying: How doth this man know letters, whereas he hath not learned? <sup>16</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. <sup>17</sup>If any man <sup><a id="jn7-fn-b-t" href="#jn7-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> will do the will of him, he shall understand of the doctrine whether it be of God, or I speak of myself. <sup>18</sup> <sup><a id="jn7-fn-c-t" href="#jn7-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory. But he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and injustice in him there is not. <sup>19</sup>Did not Moyses give you the Law, and none of you doth the law? <sup>20</sup>Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: <sup><a id="jn7-fn-d-t" href="#jn7-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> Thou hast a Devil, who seeketh to kill thee? <sup>21</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered and said to them: One work I have done; and you do all marvel. <sup>22</sup>Therefore * Moyses gave you circumcision: not that it is of Moyses, but * of the Fathers, and in the Sabboth you circumcise a man. <sup>23</sup>If a man receive circumcision in the Sabboth, that the Law of Moyses be not broken; are you angry at me because I have healed a man wholly in the Sabboth? <sup>24</sup>Judge not according to the face, but judge just judgement.

<p><sup>25</sup>Certain therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill? <sup>26</sup>And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the Princes known indeed that this is <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>? <sup>27</sup>But this man we know whence he is. But when <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span> cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. <sup>28</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore cried in the Temple teaching and saying: Both me you do know, and whence I am you know. And of myself I am not come, but he is true that sent me, whom you know not. <sup>29</sup>I know him, because I am of him, and he sent me. <sup>30</sup>They sought therefore to apprehend him; and no man laid hands upon him, because his hour was not yet come. <sup>31</sup>But of the multitude many believed in him, and said: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>, when he cometh shall he do more signs then these which this man doth? <sup>32</sup>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things touching him; and the Princes and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him. <sup>33</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore said to them: Yet a little time I am with you; and I go to him that sent me. <sup>34</sup> * You seek me, and shall not find: and where I am, you can not come. <sup>35</sup>The Jews therefore said among themselves: whither will this man go, that we shall not find him? Will he go into the dispersion of the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? <sup>36</sup>What is this saying that he hath said, You shall seek me, and shall not find; And where I am, you can not come.

  <p><sup>37</sup>And in the last, the * great day of the festivity <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink. <sup>38</sup>He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, <em>Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water</em>. <sup>39</sup>(And this he said * of the Spirit that they should receive which believed in him. <sup><a id="jn7-fn-e-t" href="#jn7-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> For as yet the Spirit was not given: because <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> was not yet glorified.)
  
  <p><sup>40</sup>Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the Prophet indeed. <sup>41</sup>Others said: This is Christ. But certain said: Why, doth <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span> come from Galilee? <sup>42</sup>Doth not the * scripture say: That of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span> doth come? <sup>43</sup>Therefore there arose dissension in the multitude for him. <sup>44</sup>And certain of them would have apprehended him; but no man laid hands upon him. <sup>45</sup>The Ministers therefore came to the chief Priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him? <sup>46</sup>The ministers answered: Never did there man so speak, as this man. <sup>47</sup>The Pharisees therefore answered them: Why, are you also seduced? <sup>48</sup>Hath any of the Princes believed in him, or of the Pharisees? <sup>49</sup>But this multitude that knoweth not the law, are accursed. <sup>50</sup>Nicodemus said to them, <sup><a id="jn7-fn-f-t" href="#jn7-fn-f" class=afn>[f]</a></sup> he * that came to him by night, who was one of them: <sup>51</sup>Doth our Law judge a man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth? <sup>52</sup>They answered and said to him: Why, art thou also a Galilaean? </em>‘Search’, and see that from Galilee a Prophet riseth not. <sup>53</sup>And every man returned to his house.
