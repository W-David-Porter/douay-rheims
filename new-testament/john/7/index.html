	<p>The Jews (of Hierusalem) seeking his death, he walketh in Galilee: where he signifieth to his brethren, that not in this feast Scenopegia, but in another (to wit, Pasch following) the Jews should kill him: that is, not when they would, but when he will. (10)&nbsp;Insomuch that at this feast he teacheth openly in the Temple, and converteth many, (14)&nbsp;both in the middle day (37)&nbsp;and the last day thereof, without any hurt, though also the Rulers send to apprehend him.

	<p>AFTER these things <span style=" font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> walked ‘into Galilee’, for he would not walk </em>‘into Jewry’: because the Jews sought to kill him. <sup>2</sup>And the festival day of the Jews, * <sup><a id="jn7-fn-a-t" href="#jn7-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> Scenopegia, was at hand. <sup>3</sup>And his Brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Jewry; that thy Disciples also may see thy works which thou doest. <sup>4</sup>For no man doth any thing in secret, and seeketh himself to be in public. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world. <sup>5</sup>For neither did his Brethren

beleeve in him. <sup>6</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore saith to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready. <sup>7</sup>The world can not hate you. but me it hateth; because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil. <sup>8</sup>Go you up to this festival day: ‘I go not up’ to this festival day; because my time is not yet accomplished.

<p><sup>9</sup>When he had said these things, himself tarried in Galilee. <sup>10</sup>But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the festival day, not openly, but as it were in secret. <sup>11</sup>The Jews therefore sought him in the festival day, and said: Where is he? <sup>12</sup>And there was much murmuring in the multitude of him. For certain said: That he is good. And others said: No, but he seduceth the multitudes. <sup>13</sup>Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.

<p><sup>14</sup>And when the festivity was now half done, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> went up into the Temple, and taught. <sup>15</sup>And the Jews marvelled, saying: How doth this man know letters, whereas he hath not learned? <sup>16</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. <sup>17</sup>If any man <sup><a id="jn7-fn-b-t" href="#jn7-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> will do the will of him, he shall understand of the doctrine whether it be of God, or I speak of myself. <sup>18</sup> <sup><a id="jn7-fn-c-t" href="#jn7-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory. But he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and injustice in him there is not. <sup>19</sup>Did not Moyses give you the Law, and none of you doth the law? <sup>20</sup>Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: <sup><a id="jn7-fn-d-t" href="#jn7-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> Thou hast a Devil, who seeketh to kill thee? <sup>21</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered and said to them: One work I have done; and you do all marvell. <sup>22</sup>Therefore * Moyses gave you circumcision: not that it is of Moyses, but * of the Fathers, and in the Sabboth you circumcise a man. <sup>23</sup>If a man receive circumcision in the Sabboth, that the Law of Moyses be not broken; are you angry at me because I have healed a man wholly in the Sabboth? <sup>24</sup>Judge not according to the face, but judge just judgement.

<p><sup>25</sup>Certain therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill? <sup>26</sup>And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the Princes known indeed that this is <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>? <sup>27</sup>But this man we know whence he is. But when <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span> cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. <sup>28</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore cried in the Temple teaching and saying: Both me you do know, and whence I am you know. And of myself I am not come, but he is true that sent me, whom you know not. <sup>29</sup>I know him, because I am of him, and he sent me. <sup>30</sup>They sought therefore to apprehend him; and no man laid hands upon him, because his hour was not yet come. <sup>31</sup>But of the multitude many believed in him, and said: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>, when he cometh shall he do more signs then these which this man doth? <sup>32</sup>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things touching him; and the Princes and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him. <sup>33</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore said to them: Yet a little time I am with you; and I go to him that sent me. <sup>34</sup> * You seek me, and shall not find: and where I am, you can not come. <sup>35</sup>The Jews therefore said among themselves: whither will this man go, that we shall not find him? Will he go into the dispersion of the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? <sup>36</sup>What is this saying that he hath said, You shall seek
