	<p style=font-style:italic>Curing a bedred man at the pond of miracle, because he doth it on the Sabboth, the blind Jews do persecute him. (7)&nbsp;And again because he saith that God is his natural father. (19)&nbsp;He thereupon continueth saying, the Father’s operation and his to be in everything all one, and that he shall do greater things than these miraculous cures, to wit, (21)&nbsp;quicken the dead in soul by sin, as being appointed Judge of all, (28)&nbsp;yea and quicken the dead in bodies also, incontinent judging all uprightly. (31)&nbsp;And that these are not brags of his own but his witnesses to be. (33)&nbsp;John Baptist, (36)&nbsp;his own miraculous works, (37)&nbsp;his Father’s voice at his Baptism, (39)&nbsp;the Scriptures also, namely of Moyses.

	<p>AFTER these things there was a festival day of the Jews, and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> went up to Hierusalem. <sup>2</sup>And there is at Jerusalem ‘upon’ <sup><a id=jn5-fn-a-t href=#jn5-fn-a class=afn>[a]</a></sup> Probatica a <a id=jn5-anno-2-t href=#jn5-anno-2 class=annotation>•</a> pond which in hebrew is surnamed ‘Bethsaida’, having five porches. <sup>3</sup>In these lay a great multitude of sick persons, of blind, lame, withered, expecting the stirring of the water. <sup>4</sup>And an Angel of our Lord descended at a certain time into the pond: and the water was stirred. And he that had gone down first into

		the pond after the stirring of the water, was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he was holden. <sup>5</sup>And there was a certain man there that had been eight and thirty years in his infirmity. <sup>6</sup>Him when <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> had seen lying, and knew that * he had now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole? <sup>7</sup>The sick man answered him: Lord, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For while I come, another goeth down before me. <sup>8</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk. <sup>9</sup>And forthwith he was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the Sabboth that day. <sup>10</sup>The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the Sabboth, thou maist not take up thy bed. <sup>11</sup>He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, take up thy bed, and walk. <sup>12</sup>They asked him therefore, what is that man that said to thee, take up thy bed, and walk? <sup>13</sup>But he that was made whole, knew not who it was. For <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> shrunk aside from the multitude standing in the place. <sup>14</sup>Afterward <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> findeth him in the Temple, and said to him: Behold thou art made whole: <a id=jn5-anno-14-t href=#jn5-anno-14 class=annotation>•</a> sin no more, lest some worse thing chance to thee. <sup>15</sup>That man went his way, and told the Jews that it was <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> that made him whole. <sup>16</sup>Thereupon the Jews persecuted <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, because he did these things on the Sabboth.

		<p><sup>17</sup>But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered them: My father worketh until now; and I do work. <sup>18</sup>Thereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him; because he did not only break the Sabboth, but also he said God was his Father, making himself aqual to God. <sup>19</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> therefore answered, and said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, The Son can not do anything of himself, but that which he seeth the Father doing. For what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner. <sup>20</sup>For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth, and greater works than these will he show him, that you may marvel. <sup>21</sup>For as the Father doth raise the dead and quickeneth; so the Son also quickeneth whom he will. <sup>22</sup>For neither doth the Father judge any man; but all judgement he hath given to the Son, <sup>23</sup>that all may honour the Son, as they do honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, doth not honour the Father, who sent him. <sup>24</sup>Amen, amen I say to you, that he which heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and he cometh not into judgement, but ‘shal pass’ from death into life. <sup>25</sup>Amen, amen I say to you, that the hour cometh, and now it is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that have heard, shall live. <sup>26</sup>For as the Father hath life in himself; so he hath given to the Son also to have life in himself; <sup>27</sup>and he hath given him power to do judgement also because he is the Son of man. <sup>28</sup>Marvel not at this, because the hour cometh wherein all that are in the graves, shall hear his voice, <sup>29</sup>and they that have <sup><a id=jn5-fn-b-t href=#jn5-fn-b class=afn>[b]</a></sup> done good things, shall come forth into the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, into the resurrection of judgement. <sup>30</sup>I can not of myself do anything. As I hear so I judge; and my judgement

		<li><a class=fn id=jn5-fn-a href=#jn5-fn-a-t>↑</a> By our Latin text and the Greek, this miraculous pond was in or upon <em>Probatica</em>, that is, a place where the sheep to be sacrificed, were kept. But by other Latin copies, St. Hierom, and some Greek Fathers, <em>Probatica</em> is the very pond itself: so called because the sheep of sacrifice were there washed.
