	<p>The Rulers dealing as if he hid himself, (1)&nbsp;he cometh to Bethania, (3)&nbsp;whereby occasion of Judas the thief murmuring at Mary Magdalen’s costly devotion, he foretelleth his death. (12)&nbsp;From thence, though they did now intend to kill Lazarus also, he rideth openly into Hierusalem, the people (because he had raised Lazarus) confessing with their acclamations that he is Christ. (20)&nbsp;Where certain Gentiles desiring to see him, (22)&nbsp;he foretelleth the conversion of the whole world from the Devil to him, to be now instant, as the effect of his death upon the Cross. (28)&nbsp;The Father also answering from Heaven to his prayer made to that purpose, (37)&nbsp;yet after all this, the Jews continue incredulous as Esay prophesied of them: (42)&nbsp;though many believed, but were ashamed to confess him. (44)&nbsp;Whereupon he showeth that it is glorious before God, and salvation to themselves to believe in him, and confess him: and damnable, to despise him.

	<p><span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> therefore six days before the Pasch came to Bethania, where Lazarus was, that had been dead, whom <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> raised. <sup>2</sup>And they made him a supper there: and Martha ministered, but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. <sup>3</sup> <sup><a id=jn_-fn-a-t href=#jn_-fn-a class=afn>[a]</a></sup> Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, precious, and anointed the feet of <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span>, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled of the odour of the ointment. <sup>4</sup>One therefore of his Disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was to betray him, said: <sup>5</sup> <a id=jn12-anno-5-t href=#jn12-anno-5 class=annotation>•</a> Why was not this ointment sold for three-hundred pence, and given to the poor? <sup>6</sup>And he said this, not because he cared for the poor: but because he was <a id=jn12-anno-6-t href=#jn12-anno-6 class=annotation>•</a> a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put in. <sup>7</sup><span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> therefore said: Let her alone that she may keep it for the day of my burial. <sup>8</sup>For the poor you have always with you: but <sup><a id=jn12-fn-b-t href=#jn12-fn-b class=afn>[b]</a></sup> <sup><a id=jn12-fn-c-t href=#jn12-fn-c class=afn>[c]</a></sup> me you shall not have always. <sup>9</sup>A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he raised from the dead. <sup>10</sup>But the chief Priests devised for to kill Lazarus also: <sup>11</sup>because many for him of the Jews went away, and believed in <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span>.


<p><sup>12</sup>And on the morrow a great multitude that was come to the festival day, when they had heard that <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> cometh to Hierusalem: <sup>13</sup>they took the * boughs of palms, and went forth to meet him, and cried: <em>Hosanna, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of our Lord, the King of Israel</em>. <sup>14</sup>And <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written, <sup>15</sup><em>Fear not daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh sitting upon an ass’s colt</em>. <sup>16</sup>These things his Disciples did not know at the first: but when <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him, and these things they did to him. <sup>17</sup>The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead. <sup>18</sup>For therefore also the multitude came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign. <sup>19</sup>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? Behold, the whole world is gone after him.

<p><sup>20</sup>And there were certain Gentiles of them that <sup><a id=jn12-fn-d-t href=#jn12-fn-d class=afn>[d]</a></sup> came up to adore in the festival day. <sup>21</sup>These therefore came to Philip who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we are desirous to see <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span>. <sup>22</sup>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span>. <sup>23</sup>But <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man shall be glorified. <sup>24</sup>Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground, die: itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth much fruit. <sup>25</sup>He that loveth his life shall lose it: and he that hateth his life in this world, doth keep it to life everlasting. <sup>26</sup>If any man minister to me, let him follow me: and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, my father will honour him. <sup>27</sup>Now my soul is troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But therefore came I into this hour. <sup>28</sup>Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from Heaven: Both I have glorified it, and again I will glorify it. <sup>29</sup>The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An Angel spoke to him. <sup>30</sup><span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> answered, and said: This voice came not for me, but for your sake. <sup>31</sup>Now is the judgement of the world; now the Prince of this world shall cast forth. <sup>32</sup>And I, if I be exalted from the earth, will draw all things to myself. <sup>33</sup>(And this he said, signifying what death he should die.) <sup>34</sup>The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Christ</span> abideth for ever; and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be exalted? Who is this Son of man? <sup>35</sup><span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk while you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh
