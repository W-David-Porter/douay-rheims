(19)&nbsp;He thereupon continueth saying, the Father’s operation and his to be in everything all one, and that he shall do greater things than these miraculous cures, to wit, (21)&nbsp;quicken the dead in soul by sin, as being appointed Judge of all, (28)&nbsp;yea and quicken the dead in bodies also, incontinent judging all uprightly. (31)&nbsp;And that these are not brags of his own but his witnesses to be.
