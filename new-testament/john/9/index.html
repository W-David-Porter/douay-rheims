	<p><em>To show that by his Baptism (being the Sacrament of illumination or faith) he will take away the blindness of the world, he giveth with strange ceremonies sight to one born blind. (8)&nbsp;By which wonderful miracle (the attestation of the party himself and of his parents concurring) first the neighbours, then also the Pharisees themselves are plainly confounded. Yet so obstinate they are, that because it was the Sabboth when he wrought it, they infer that he is not of God: yea and throw out of their Synagogue the party for confessing him. (35)&nbsp;But our Lord, receiveth him; (39)&nbsp;and foretelleth by this occasion, the excecation, of the Jews (because of their wilful obstinacy) and illumination of the Gentiles who confess their own blindness.</em>

	<p>AND <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> passing by, saw a man blind from his nativity; <sup>2</sup>and his Disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind? <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span> answered: <sup>3</sup> <sup><a id=jn9-fn-a-t href=#jn9-fn-a class=afn>[a]</a></sup> Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God may be manifested in him. <sup>4</sup>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day.

He went therefore, and washed; and he came seeing.

  <p><sup>8</sup>Therefore the neighbours, and they which had seen him before, that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat, and begged? Others said: That this is he. <sup>9</sup>But others: No, not so, but he is like him. But he said: That I am he. <sup>10</sup>They said therefore to him: How were thine eyes opened? <sup>11</sup>He answered: That man that is called <span style=font-variant:small-caps>Jesus</span>, made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, and washed, and saw. <sup>12</sup>And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not. <sup>13</sup>They bring him that had been
