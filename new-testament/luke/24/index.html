	<p><em>Devout women not finding his body in the Sepulchre, (4)&nbsp;Angels tell them that he is risen according to his own prediction: (9)&nbsp;yet the Apostles will not believe it. (12)&nbsp;But neither Peter findeth his body there. (13)&nbsp;He walketh with two Disciples, declaring all this unto them out of the Scriptures, and is known of them by breaking of bread. (36)&nbsp;The same day he appeareth to the Apostles being together, is felt of them, and eateth with them. Finally teaching them out of the Scriptures not only of his Passion and Resurrection, (47)&nbsp;but also of his Catholic Church, (49)&nbsp;he promiseth the Holy Ghost to confirm them, (50)&nbsp;and so ascendeth into Heaven.</em></p>

	<p>AND in the <sup><a id="lk24-fn-a-t" href="#lk24-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup>first of the Sabboth very early they came to the monument, carrying the spices which they had prepared. <sup>2</sup>And they found the stone rolled back from the monument. <sup>3</sup>And going in, they found not the body of our Lord <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>. <sup>4</sup>And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold two men stood beside them in glistering apparel. <sup>5</sup>And when they feared and cast down their countenance toward the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead? <sup>6</sup>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke to you, when he yet was in Galilee, <sup>7</sup>saying, * That the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinners and be crucified, and the third day rise again. <sup>8</sup>And they remembered his words. <sup>9</sup>And going back from the monument, they told all these things to those eleven, and to all the rest. <sup>10</sup>And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joan, and Mary of James, and the rest that were with them, which said these things to the Apostles. <sup>11</sup>And these words seemed before them as dotage, and they did not believe them.</p>

	<p><sup>12</sup>But * Peter rising up ran to the monument; and stooping down he saw the linen clothes lying alone, and went away marvelling with himself at that which was done.</p>

	<p><sup>13</sup> * And behold, two of them went the same day into a town which was the space of sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus. <sup>14</sup>And they talked betwixt themselves of all those things that had chanced. <sup>15</sup>And it came to pass, while they talked and reasoned with themselves, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> also himself approaching went with them. <sup>16</sup>But their eyes were held that they might not know him. <sup>17</sup>And he said to them: What are these communications that you confer one with another walking, and are sad? <sup>18</sup>And one whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done in it, these days? <sup>19</sup>To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> of Nazareth, who was a man a Prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people. <sup>20</sup>And how our chief Priests and Princes delivered him into condemnation of death, and crucified him. <sup>21</sup>But we hoped that it was he that should redeem Israel; and now besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done. <sup>22</sup>But certain women also of ours, made us afraid; who before it was light, were at the monument, <sup>23</sup>and not finding his body, came, saying that they saw a vision also of Angels, who say that he is alive. <sup>24</sup>And certain men of ours went to the monument; and they found it so as the woman said, but him they found not. <sup>25</sup>And he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the Prophets have spoken. <sup>26</sup>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory? <sup>27</sup>And beginning from Moyses and all the Prophets, he did interpret to them in all the scriptures the things that were concerning him. <sup>28</sup>And they drew nigh to the town whither they went; and he made semblance to go further. <sup>29</sup>And they forced him, saying: Tarry with us, because it is toward night, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them. <sup>30</sup>And it came to pass, while he sat at the table with them, he <a id="lk24-anno-30-t" href="#lk24-anno-30" class="annotation">•</a> took bread, and blessed and broke, and did reach to them. <sup>31</sup>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. <sup>32</sup>And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning in us, while he spoke in the way, and opened unto us the scriptures? <sup>33</sup>And rising up the same hour they went back into Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were with them, <sup>34</sup>saying: That our Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. <sup>35</sup>And they told the things that were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of bread.</p>

	<p><sup>36</sup> * And while they speak these things, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> stood in the midst of them, and he saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I. Fear not. <sup>37</sup>But they being troubled and frightened, imagined that they saw a Spirit. <sup>38</sup>And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and cogitations arise into your hearts? <sup>39</sup>See my hands, and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have. <sup>40</sup>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup>41</sup>But they yet not believing and marvelling for joy, he said: Have you here anything to be eaten? <sup>42</sup>But they offered him a piece of fish broiled, and a honeycomb. <sup>43</sup>And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains he gave to them.</p>

	<p><sup>44</sup>And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, when I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moyses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, of me. <sup>45</sup>Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures. <sup>46</sup>And he said to them: That so it is written, and so it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the third day; <sup>47</sup> <sup><a id="lk24-fn-b-t" href="#lk24-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> and <a id="lk24-anno-47-t" href="#lk24-anno-47" class="annotation">•</a> penance to be preached in his name and remission of sins unto all Nations, beginning from Jerusalem. <sup>48</sup>And you are witnesses of these things. <sup>49</sup> * And I send the promise of my Father upon you; but you, tarry in the city, till you be endowed with power from high.
</p>

	<p><sup>50</sup>And he brought them forth abroad into Bethania; and lifting up his hands <a id="lk24-anno-50-t" href="#lk24-anno-50" class="annotation">•</a> he blessed them. <sup>51</sup> * And it came to pass while he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried into Heaven. <sup>52</sup>And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy; <sup>53</sup>and they were always in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. XXIV.</h4>
	<p><a id="lk24-anno-30" href="#lk24-anno-30-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 30. <em>Took bread.</em>) The Fathers in diverse places take this to be meant of the Bl. Sacrament. Paulinus himself in the next epistle before that, among St. Augustine. Venerable Bede also upon this place. Theophylact upon this place. And that it should be meant of the holy Sacrament: the form of solemn taking the bread into his hands, blessing it, breaking it, and reaching it to his Disciples (exceeding proper to the consecration, and common to none other vulgar benediction, nor anywhere used but in Christ’s miraculous multiplying the loaves) and the singular effect in notifying Christ unto them, do prove. And if it be the Sacrament (as it is most probable) then is it an evident example and warrant of ministration in one kind.</p>

	<p><a id="lk24-anno-47" href="#lk24-anno-47-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 47. <em>Penance to be preached.</em>) He showed unto them out of the Scriptures, not only the things that were now accomplished in himself, but also that were yet to come about his Church: as, where it should begin, to wit, at Jerusalem and how far it should go, to wit, to all Nations: that he might not suffer us (saith St. Augustine) to err neither in the bridegroom nor in the bride. For this maketh manifestly against all Heretics and Schismatics, that set up new Churches in particular countries, drawing the people from the foresaid only true Church which from Jerusalem so groweth * over all Nations till the end of the world come.
</p>

	<p><a id="lk24-anno-50" href="#lk24-anno-50-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 50. <em>Blessed them.</em>) Christ our high priest, * prefigured specially therein by Melchisedech, often gave his blessing to his: somtimes by words, as, <em>Peace be to you</em>: somtimes by imposing his hands: and now hereby lifting up his hands over his Disciples as it were for his farewell. In what form, the Scripture doth not express, but very like it is that in form of the cross, as Jacob the Patriarch blessed his nephews for signification of Christ’s benediction: for now the cross began to be glorious among the faithful, and the Apostles (as it is most certain * by the Fathers which call it an ancient tradition) used that sign for an external note of benediction. Yea St. Augustine saith (<em>in Ps. 30. Conc. 3</em>) that Christ himself not without cause would have his sign to be fixed in our foreheads as in the seat of shamefastness, that a Christian man should not be ashamed of the reproach of Christ. And what form can a Christian man use rather to bless himself or others, than that which was dedicated in Christ’s death, and is a convenient memorial of the same? Howsoever it be, that the Bishops and Priests of God’s Church bless with an external sign, no man can reprehend, being warranted by Christ’s own example and action.</p>
