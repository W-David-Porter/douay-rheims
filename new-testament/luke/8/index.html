	<p><em>Going over all Galilee with his train, (4)&nbsp;he preacheth to the Jews in parables because of their reprobation, (9)&nbsp;but to his Disciples manifestly; because he will not for the Jews incredulity have his coming frustrate: (19)&nbsp;signifying also that we are his kin (though we be Gentiles) and not his carnal brethren the Jews. (22)&nbsp;To whom also (signified by the Gerasens) after the tempest in his sleep (that is, in his death) and calm in his resurrection, he cometh: but they preferring their temporals before his presence, he leaveth them again. (41)&nbsp;Likewise coming to cure the Jews (who were born when the Gentiles sickened about Abraham’s time) he is prevented with the faith of the Gentiles, and then the Jews die, but them also in the end he will restore.</em></p>

<div class=verse>
	<p>AND it came to pass afterward, and he made his journey by cities and towns preaching and evangelizing the Kingdom of God; and the Twelve with him, <sup>2</sup>and some women that had been cured of wicked Spirits and infirmities; * Mary which is called Magdalene, out of whom seven Devils were gone forth, <sup>3</sup>and Joanne the wife of Chusa Herod’s Procurator, and Susan, and </em><sup>c</sup> many others that <a id="lk8-anno-3-t" href="#lk8-anno-3" class="annotation">•</a> did minister unto him of their substance.</p>

	<p><sup>4</sup>And * when a very great multitude assembled and hastened out of the cities unto him, he said by a similitude. <sup>5</sup>The sower went forth to sow his seed. And while he soweth, some fell by the wayside, and was trodden upon, and the fowls of the air did eat it. <sup>6</sup>And othersome fell upon the rock: and being shot up, it withered, because it had not moisture. <sup>7</sup>And othersome fell among thorns, and the thorns growing up withal, choked it. <sup>8</sup>And othersome fell upon good ground; and being shot up, yielded fruit a hundred fold. Saying these things he cried: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

	<p><sup>9</sup>And his Disciples asked him what this parable was. <sup>10</sup>To whom he said: To you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables, <sup><a id="lk8-fn-a-t" href="#lk8-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> that * seeing they may not see, and hearing may not understand. <sup>11</sup>And the parable is this: The seed, is the Word of God. <sup>12</sup>And they besides the way, are those that hear, then the Devil cometh, and taketh the Word out of their heart, lest believing they be saved. <sup>13</sup>For they upon the rock; such as when they hear, with joy receive the Word: and these have no roots; because <sup><a id="lk8-fn-b-t" href="#lk8-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> for a time they believe, and in time of tentation they revolt. <sup>14</sup>And that which fell into thorns, are they that have heard, and going their ways, are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and render not fruit. <sup>15</sup>And that upon good ground, are they which in a good and very good heart, hearing the word, do retain it, and yield fruit in patience.</p>

	<p><sup>16</sup>And no man lighting a candle doth cover it with a vessel, or put it under a bed; but setteth it upon a candlestick, that they that enter in, may see the light. <sup>17</sup>For there is not anything secret, that shall not be made manifest; nor hid, that shall not be known, and come abroad. <sup>18</sup>See therefore how you hear. For he that hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, that also which he thinketh he hath, shall be taken away from him.</p>

	<p><sup>19</sup>And * his mother and brethren came unto him; and they could not come at him for the multitude. <sup>20</sup>And it was told him: Thy mother and <a id="lk8-anno-20-t" href="#lk8-anno-20" class="annotation">•</a> thy brethren stand without, desirous to see thee. <sup>21</sup>Who answering said to them: My <sup><a id="lk8-fn-c-t" href="#lk8-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> mother and my brethren, are they that hear the word of God and do it.</p>

	<p><sup>22</sup> * And it came to pass one day; and he went up into a boat, and his Disciples, and he said to them: Let us strike over the lake. And they launched forth. <sup>23</sup>And when they were sailing, he slept; and there fell a storm of wind into the lake, and they <sup>c</sup> were filled, and were in danger. <sup>24</sup>And <sup><a id="lk8-fn-d-t" href="#lk8-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> they came and raised him, saying: Master, we perish. But he rising, rebuked the wind and the tempest of water; and it ceased, and there was made a calm. <sup>25</sup>And he said to them: Where is your faith? Who fearing, marvelled one to another, saying: Who is this (trow ye) that he commandeth both the winds and the sea, and they obey him? <sup>26</sup> * And they sailed to the country of the Gerasens which is over against Galilee.</p>

	<p><sup>27</sup>And when he was come forth to the land, there met him a certain man that had a Devil now a very long time, and he did wear no clothes, neither did he tarry in house, but in the monuments. <sup>28</sup>And as he saw <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, he fell down before him; and crying out with a great voice, he said: What is to me and thee <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> Son of God most high? I beseech thee do not torment me. <sup>29</sup>For he commanded the unclean Spirit to go forth out of the man. For many times he caught him, and he was bound with chains, and kept with fetters; and breaking the bonds was driven of the Devil into the deserts. <sup>30</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> asked him saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion; because many Devils were entered into him. <sup>31</sup>And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the depth. <sup>32</sup>And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they desired him that he would permit them to enter into them. And he permitted them. <sup>33</sup>The Devils therefore went forth out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the heard with violence went headlong into the lake, and was stifled. <sup>34</sup>Which when the swineherds saw done, they fled, and told into the city and into the towns. <sup>35</sup>And they went forth to see that which was done; and they came to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, and found the man, out of whom the Devils were gone forth, sitting at his feet, clothed, and well in his wits, and they were afraid. <sup>36</sup>And they also that had seen, told them how he had been made whole from the legion. <sup>37</sup>And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear. And he going up into the boat, returned. <sup>38</sup>And the man out of whom the Devils were departed, desired him that he might be with him. But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> dismissed him, saying: <sup>39</sup>Return into thy house, and tell how great things God hath done to thee. And he went through the whole city, preaching how great things <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> had done to him.</p>

	<p><sup>40</sup>And it came to pass; when <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> was returned, the multitude received him. And all were expecting him. <sup>41</sup>And * behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was Prince of the Synagogue: and he fell at the feet of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, desiring him that he would enter into his house, <sup>42</sup>because he had an only daughter almost twelve years old, and she was a dying. And it chanced, while he went, he was thronged of the multitudes.</p>

	<p><sup>43</sup>And there was <sup><a id="lk8-fn-e-t" href="#lk8-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> a certain woman in a flux of blood from twelve years past, which had bestowed all her substance upon Physicians, neither could she be cured of any: <sup>44</sup>she came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and forthwith the flux of her blood stinted. <sup>45</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said: Who is it that touched me? And all denying, <sup><a id="lk8-fn-f-t" href="#lk8-fn-f" class=afn>[f]</a></sup> Peter said, and they that were with him: Master, the multitudes throng and press thee, and doest thou say, Who touched me? <sup>46</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said: Somebody hath touched me; for I know that there is virtue proceeded from me. <sup>47</sup>And the woman seeing, that she was not hid, came trembling, and fell down before his feet; and for what cause she had touched him, she shewed before all the People, and how forthwith she was made whole. <sup>48</sup>But he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee safe, go thy way in peace.</p>

	<p><sup>49</sup>As he was yet speaking, there cometh one to the Prince of the Synagogue, saying to him: That thy daughter is dead, trouble him not. <sup>50</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> hearing this word, answered the father of the maid: Fear not; <sup><a id="lk8-fn-g-t" href="#lk8-fn-g" class=afn>[g]</a></sup> believe only, and she shall be safe. <sup>51</sup>And when he was come to the house, he permitted not any man to enter in with him, but Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the maid. <sup>52</sup>And all wept, and mourned for her. But he said: Weep not, the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. <sup>53</sup>And they derided him, knowing that she was dead. <sup>54</sup>But he holding her hand cried saying: Maid arise. <sup>55</sup>And <a id="lk8-anno-55-t" href="#lk8-anno-55" class="annotation">•</a> her spirit returned, and she rose incontinent. And he bade them give her to eat. <sup>56</sup>And her parents were astonished, whom he commanded to tell no man that which was done.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. VIII.</h4>
	<p><a id="lk8-anno-3" href="#lk8-anno-3-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 3. <em>That did minister</em>.) It was the custom of the Jews that women of their substance did minister meat and drink and cloth to their teachers, going about with them. Which because it might have been scandalous among the Gentiles, St. Paul maketh mention that he used it not. And they ministered to our Lord of their substance for this cause, that he whose spiritual benefits they reaped, might reap their carnal things.</p>

	<p><a id="lk8-anno-20" href="#lk8-anno-20-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 20. <em>Thy brethren</em>.) These brethren of our Lord, were not the sons of the Bl. Virgin MARY the mother of God, </em>as Helvidius wickedly taught: neither are they to be thought (as some others say) the sons of Joseph by another wife: for (as St. Jerom writeth) not only our Lady was a virgin, but by reason of her, Joseph also: that our Saviour might be born of a virginal matrimony. But they are called his brethren (according to the usual speech of the Scriptures) because they were his cousins, either the sons of Joseph’s brother, or (as the more received opinion is) the sons of our Lady’s sister called Mary of James, which James therefore is also called the brother of our Lord.</p>

	<p><a id="lk8-anno-55" href="#lk8-anno-55-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 55. <em>Her spirit returned.</em>) This returning of the souls again into the bodies of them whom CHRIST and his Apostles raised from death (specially Lazarus who had been dead four days) doth evidently prove a third place against our adversaries, that say, every one goeth straight to Heaven or to Hell. For it cannot be thought that they were called from the one or the other, and therefore from some third place.</p>
