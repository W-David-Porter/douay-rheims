	<p><em>His Twelve also now preaching everywhere and working miracles. (6)&nbsp;Herod and all do wonder much. (10)&nbsp;After which, he taketh them and goeth into the wilderness: where he cures and teacheth, feeding 5000 with five loaves. (18)&nbsp;Peter confessing him to be Christ, (21)&nbsp;he on the other side foretelleth his Passion, and that all must in time of persecution follow him therein. (27)&nbsp;Whereunto to encourage us the more, (27)&nbsp;he giveth in his Transfiguration a sight of the glory, which is the reward of suffering. (37)&nbsp;The next day he casteth out a Devil which his Disciples could not. (43)&nbsp;Whom amidst these wonders he forewarneth again of his scandalous Passion. (49)&nbsp;And to cure their ambition, he telleth them, that the most humble he esteemeth most: (49)&nbsp;bidding them also not to prohibit any that is not against them. (51)&nbsp;Yea and toward such as be against them Schismatically, to show mildness for all that. (57)&nbsp;Of following him, three examples.</em></p>

	<p>AND calling together the twelve Apostles, he gave them <sup><a id="lk9-fn-a-t" href="#lk9-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> virtue and power over all Devils, and to cure maladies. <sup>2</sup>And he sent them to preach the Kingdom of God; and to heal the sick. <sup>3</sup>And he said to them: Take nothing for the way, neither rod, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money, neither have two coats. <sup>4</sup>And into whatsoever house you enter, tarry there, and thence do not depart. <sup>5</sup>And whosoever shall not receive you, going forth out of that city, shake off the dust also of your feet <sup><a id="lk9-fn-b-t" href="#lk9-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> for a testimony upon them. <sup>6</sup>And going forth they went a circuit from town to town evangelizing and curing every where.</p>

	<p><sup>7</sup>And * Herod the Tetrarch heard all things that were done by him; and he staggered because it was said of some: That John was risen from the dead. <sup>8</sup>But of othersome: That Elias hath appeared; and of others: that a Prophet one of the old ones was risen. <sup>9</sup>And Herod said: John I have beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he sought for to see him.</p>

	<p><sup>10</sup>And * the Apostles being returned, reported to him whatsoever they did: and taking them he retired apart into a desert place, which belongeth to Beth-saida. <sup>11</sup>Which the multitudes understanding, followed him and he received them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and them that had need of cure he healed. <sup>12</sup>And the day began to draw towards an end. And the Twelve coming near, said to him: Dismiss the multitudes, that going into towns and villages here about, they may have lodging, and find meats; because here we are in a desert place. <sup>13</sup>And he said to them: Give you them to eat. But they said: We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; unless perhaps we should go and buy meats for all this multitude. <sup>14</sup>And there were men almost five thousand. And he said to his Disciples: Make them sit down by companies fifty and fifty. <sup>15</sup>And so they did. And they made all sit down. <sup>16</sup>And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up unto Heaven, and <sup>c</sup> <sup><a id="lk9-fn-c-t" href="#lk9-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> blessed them; and he broke, and distributed to his Disciples, for to set before the multitudes. <sup>17</sup>And <sup><a id="lk9-fn-d-t" href="#lk9-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> they did all eat, and had their fill. And there was taken up that which remained to them, twelve baskets of fragments.</p>

	<p><sup>18</sup> * And it came to pass; when he was alone praying, his Disciples also were with him; and he asked them saying: Whom do the multitudes say that I am? <sup>19</sup>But they answered, and said: John the Baptist; and some, Elias; but some, that one of the Prophets before time is risen. <sup>20</sup>And he said to them: But whom say ye that I am? Simon Peter answering, said: The Christ of God. <sup>21</sup>But he rebuking them, commanded that they should tell this to no man, <sup>22</sup>saying: That the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the Ancients and chief Priests and Scribes, and be killed, and the third day rise again.</p>

	<p><sup>23</sup>And he said to all: If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. <sup>24</sup>For he that will save his life, shall lose it; for he that shall lose his life for my sake, shall save it. <sup>25</sup>For what profit hath a man if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, and cast away himself? <sup>26</sup>For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words, him the Son of man shall be ashamed of, when he shall come in his majesty, and his Father’s, and of the holy Angels. <sup>27</sup>And I say to you assuredly: There be some standing here that shall not taste death, <a id="lk9-anno-27-t" href="#lk9-anno-27" class="annotation">•</a> till they see the Kingdom of God.</p>

	<p><sup>28</sup> * And it came to pass after these words almost eight days, and he took Peter and James and John, and went into a mountain to pray. <sup>29</sup>And while he prayed, the shape of his countenance was altered: and his raiment white and glistering. <sup>30</sup>And behold two men talked with him. And they were Moyses and Elias, <sup>31</sup>appearing in majesty. And they told his decease that he should accomplish in Hierusalem. <sup>32</sup>But Peter and they that were with him, were heavy with sleep. And awaking, they saw his majesty, and the two men that stood with him. <sup>33</sup>And it came to pass, when they departed from him, Peter said to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>: Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moyses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. <sup>34</sup>And as he spoke these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared, when they entered into the cloud. <sup>35</sup> * And a voice was made out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, hear him. <sup>36</sup>And while the voice was made, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of these things which they had seen.</p>

	<p><sup>37</sup> * And it came to pass the day following, when they came down from the mountain, there met him a great multitude. <sup>38</sup>And behold a man of the multitude cried out, saying: Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son because he is mine only one. <sup>39</sup>And lo, the spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth, and he dasheth him, and teareth him that he foameth, and with much ado departeth renting him. <sup>40</sup>And I desired thy Disciples to cast him out, and they could not. <sup>41</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering said: <sup><a id="lk9-fn-e-t" href="#lk9-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? bring hither thy son. <sup>42</sup>And when he came to him, the Devil dashed, and tore him. And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and rendered him to his father. <sup>43</sup>And all were astonished at the might of God; and all marvelling at all things that he did, he said to his Disciples: <sup>44</sup>Lay you in your hearts these words, for it shall come to pass that the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. <sup>45</sup>But they did not know this word, and it was covered before them, that they perceived it not. And they were afraid to ask him of this word.</p>

	<p><sup>46</sup> * And there entered <sup><a id="lk9-fn-f-t" href="#lk9-fn-f" class=afn>[f]</a></sup> a cogitation into them, which of them should be greater. <sup>47</sup>But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> seeing the cogitations of their heart, took a child and set him by him, <sup>48</sup>and said to them, whosoever receiveth this child in my name, receiveth me, and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. For he that is the lesser among you all, he is the greater.</p>

	<p><sup>49</sup> * And John answering said: Master, we saw a certain man casting out Devils in thy name, and we prohibited him, because he followeth not with us. <sup>50</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: <sup><a id="lk9-fn-g-t" href="#lk9-fn-g" class=afn>[g]</a></sup> Prohibit not. For he that is not against you, is for you.</p>

	<p><sup>51</sup>And it came to pass, while the days of his assumption were accomplishing, and he fixed his face to go into Jerusalem. <sup>52</sup>And he sent messengers before his face; and going they entered into a city of the Samaritans to prepare for him. <sup>53</sup>And they received him not, because his <a id="lk9-anno-53-t" href="#lk9-anno-53" class="annotation">•</a> face was to go to Jerusalem. <sup>54</sup>And when his Disciples James and John had seen it, they said: Lord wilt thou we say that fire come down from Heaven and consume </em>‘them’? <sup>55</sup>And turning, <a id="lk9-anno-55-t" href="#lk9-anno-55" class="annotation">•</a> he rebuked them, saying: You know not of what spirit you are. <sup>56</sup>The Son of man came not to destroy souls, but to save. And they went into another town.</p>

	<p><sup>57</sup>And it came to pass as they walked in the way, a certain man said to him: * I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. <sup>58</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: <sup><a id="lk9-fn-h-t" href="#lk9-fn-h" class=afn>[h]</a></sup> The foxes have holes, and the fowls of the air nests; but the Son of man hath not where to repose his head. <sup>59</sup>But he said to another: Follow me. And he said: Lord, permit me first to go, and to bury my father. <sup>60</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou, set forth the Kingdom of God. <sup>61</sup>And another said: I will follow thee Lord, but permit me first to take my leave of them that are at home. <sup>62</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: <a id="lk9-anno-62-t" href="#lk9-anno-62" class="annotation">•</a> No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is apt for the Kingdom of God.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS CHAPTER IX</h4>
	<p><a id="lk9-anno-27" href="#lk9-anno-27-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 27. <em>Till they see</em>.) To the Apostles, that had to preach the Kingdom of God and to suffer so much misery for the same in this world, he would show his glory, and give them a taste of his own joyful state and of his Saints in Heaven, calling thither Moyses and Elias, that the Law and Prophets might be witnesses of the same. See the annotation upon St. Matthew c. 17, 2.</p>

	<p><a id="lk9-anno-53" href="#lk9-anno-53-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 53. <em>Face to go to Jerusalem</em>.) The Samaritans were Schismatics from the Jews, and had a Schismatical temple in mount Garizim, of purpose to draw men thither from God’s temple in Jerusalem, where only was the true and as it were the Catholic service and Sacrifice unto God. Therefore they did not gladly receive our Saviour, because they perceived he was going to Jerusalem.</p>

	<p><a id="lk9-anno-55" href="#lk9-anno-55-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 55. <em>He rebuked them</em>.) Not justice nor all rigorous punishment of sinners is here forbidden, nor Elias fact reprehended, nor the Church or Christian Princes blamed for putting Heretics to death: but that none of these should be done for desire of our particular revenge, or without discretion, and regard of their amendment, and example to others. Therefore St. Peter used his power upon Ananias and Sapphira, when he struck them both down to death for defrauding the Church.</p>

	<p><a id="lk9-anno-62" href="#lk9-anno-62-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 62. <em>No man looking back</em>.) It is a dangerous temptation for a man that hath lost or left his goods for Christ, to look much back at them, and to remember with delight the pleasures and eases of this world. For it breedeth in him discontentment of the troubles and crosses that are incident to the state of such as fully follow Christ. In which case a man should ever look forward towards Heaven, and never backward to the world.</p>
