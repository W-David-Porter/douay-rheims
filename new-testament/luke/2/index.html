<div class=verse>
	<p>AND it came to pass, in those days there came forth an edict from Caesar Augustus, that the whole world should be enrolled. <sup>2</sup>This first enrolling was made by the President of Syria Cyrinus. <sup>3</sup>And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city. <sup>4</sup>And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Jewry, to the city of David that is called Beth-lehem: for because he was of the house and family of David, <sup>5</sup>to be enrolled with <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mary</span> his despoused wife that was with child. <sup>6</sup>And it came to pass, when they were there, her days were fully come that she should be delivered. <sup>7</sup>And she brought forth her first begotten Son, and swaddled him in clothes, and laid him down in a manger; because there was not place for them in the inn.</p>
	
	<p><sup>8</sup>And there were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the night watches over their flock. <sup>9</sup>And behold, an Angel of our Lord stood beside them, and the brightness of God did shine round about them, and they feared with a great fear. <sup>10</sup>And the Angel said to them: Fear not; for behold I evangelise to you great joy, that shall be to all the People: <sup>11</sup>because this day is born to you a <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Saviour</span> which is Christ our Lord, in the city of David. <sup>12</sup>And this shall be a sign to you; You shall find the infant swaddled in clothes, and laid in a manger. <sup>13</sup>And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God, and saying, <sup>14</sup><em>Glory in the highest to God: and in earth peace to <a id="lk2-anno-14-t" href="#lk2-anno-14" class="annotation">•</a> men of good will.</em> <sup>15</sup> <sup>b</sup> And it came to pass, after the Angels departed from them into Heaven, the shepherds spoke one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see this Word that is done, which our Lord hath showed to us. <sup>16</sup>And they came with speed; and they found <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mary</span> and Joseph, and the infant laid in the manger. <sup>17</sup>And seeing it, they understood of the Word that had been spoken to them concerning this child. <sup>18</sup>And all that heard, did marvel; and concerning those things that were reported to them by the shepherds. <sup>19</sup>But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mary</span> <a id="lk2-anno-19-t" href="#lk2-anno-19" class="annotation">•</a> kept all these words, conferring them in her heart. <sup>20</sup>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God in all things that they had heard, and seen, as it was said to them.</p>


	<p><sup>21</sup> <sup>c</sup> And * after eight days were expired, that the child should be circumcised; his name was called <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, which was * called by the Angel, before that he was conceived in the womb.</p>

	<sup>22</sup> <sup>d</sup> And after the days were fully ended of her purification according to the law of Moyses, they carried him into Jerusalem, to present him to our Lord <sup>23</sup>as it is written in the law of our Lord, <em>That every male opening the matrix, shall be called holy to the Lord</em>. <sup>24</sup>and to give a sacrifice * according as it is written in the law of our Lord, a pair of turtles, or two young pigeons. <sup>25</sup>And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was just and religious, expecting the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was in him. <sup>26</sup>And he had received an answer of the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death unless he saw first the <sup>e</sup> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span> of our Lord. <sup>27</sup>And he came in Spirit into the temple. And when his parents brought in the child <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, to do according to the custom of the Law for him, <sup>28</sup>he also took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</p>

	<p><sup>29</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Now thou</span> <em>doest dismiss thy servant O Lord, according to thy word in peace</em>.</p>

	<p><sup>30</sup><em>Because my eyes have seen thy</em> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Salvation</span>,</p>

	<p><sup>31</sup><em>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all Peoples:</em></p>

	<p><sup>32</sup><em>A light to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy People Israel.</em></p>

	<p><sup>33</sup>And his father and mother were marvelling upon those things which were spoken concerning him. <sup>34</sup>And Simeon blessed them, and said to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mary</span> his mother: Behold this is set <a id="lk2-anno-34-t" href="#lk2-anno-34" class="annotation">•</a> unto the ruin, and unto the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted, <sup>35</sup>and <sup><a id="lk2-fn-a-t" href="#lk2-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> thine own soul shall a sword pierce, that out of many hearts cogitations may be revealed. <sup>36</sup>And there was Anne a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was far stricken in days, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity. <sup>37</sup>And she was <a id="lk2-anno-37a-t" href="#lk2-anno-37a" class="annotation">•</a> a widow until eighty and four years; who departed not from the Temple, <a id="lk2-anno-37b-t" href="#lk2-anno-37b" class="annotation">•</a> by fastings and prayers serving night and day. <sup>38</sup>And she at the same hour suddenly coming in, confessed to our Lord; and spoke of him to all that expected the redemption of Israel. <sup>39</sup>And after they had wholly done all things according to the law of our Lord, they returned into Galilee, into their city Nazareth.</p>

	<p><sup>40</sup>And the child grew, and waxed ′strong: full of wisdom, and the grace of God was in him. <sup>41</sup>And his parents went every year unto Jerusalem, at the solemn day of Pasche. <sup>42</sup> <sup>f</sup> And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem according to the custom of the festival day; <sup>43</sup>and having ended the days, when they returned, the child <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> remained in Jerusalem: and his parents knew it not. <sup>44</sup>And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day’s journey, and sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances. <sup>45</sup>And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him. <sup>46</sup>And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the Temple sitting in the midst of the Doctors, hearing them and asking them. <sup>47</sup>And all were astonished that heard him, upon his wisdom and answers.</p>

	<p><sup>48</sup>And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou so done to us? behold thy father and I sorrowing did seek thee. <sup>49</sup>And he said to them: What is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about those things, which are my Fathers? <sup>50</sup>And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them. <sup>51</sup>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth: and was <a id="lk2-anno-51-t" href="#lk2-anno-51" class="annotation">•</a> subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart. <sup>52</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> proceeded in wisdom and age, and grace with God and men.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. 2.</h4>
	<p><a id="lk2-anno-14" href="#lk2-anno-14-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 14. <em>Men of good will</em>.) The birth of Christ giveth not peace of mind or salvation but to such as be of good will, because he worketh not our good against our wills, but our wills concurring. <em>Aug. quaet. ad Simplic. lib. 1. q. 2. to. 4.</em></p>

	<p><a id="lk2-anno-19" href="#lk2-anno-19-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 19. <em>Kept all</em>.) Our Lady though little be spoken of her concerning such matters in the Scriptures, because she was a woman, and not admitted to teach or dispute in public of high mysteries; yet she knew all these mysteries, and wisely noted and contemplated of those things that were done and said about Christ, from the first hour of his Conception till the end of his life and his Ascension.</p>

	<p><a id="lk2-anno-34" href="#lk2-anno-34-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 34. <em>To the ruin</em>.) Therefore to the ruin of some, because they would not believe in him, and so were the cause of their own ruin, as he is elsewhere called, <em>A stumbling stone</em>, because many would stumble at him and so fall by their own fault. Othersome he raised by grace from sin to justice, and so he was the resurrection of many. The Apostle useth the like speech, saying: <em>We are to some the odour of life, unto life: to others, the odour of death unto death</em>. Not that their preaching was to cause death, but because they that would not believe their preaching, wilfully incurred deadly sin and damnation.</p>

	<p><a id="lk2-anno-37a" href="#lk2-anno-37a-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 37. <em>A widow</em>.) Mark that widowhood is here mentioned to the commendation thereof even in the old Testament also, and the fruit, and as it were the profession thereof, is here commended, to wit, fasting, praying, being continually in the Temple even as St. Paul more at large for the state of the new Testament speaketh of widowhood and virginity, as being professions more apt and commodious for the service of God.</p>

	<p><a id="lk2-anno-37b" href="#lk2-anno-37b-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 37. <em>By fastings and prayers serving</em>.) Serving, in the Greek is λατρευουσα, that is, doing divine worship unto God, as by prayer, so also by fasting: so that fasting is λατρεια, that is, an act of Religion whereby we do worship God, as we do by prayer, and not used only to subdue our flesh, much less (as Heretics would have it) as a matter of policy.</p>

	<p><a id="lk2-anno-51" href="#lk2-anno-51-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 51. <em>Subject to them</em>.) All children may learn hereby, that great ought to be their subjection and obedience to their Parents, when Christ himself, being God, would be subject to his parents being but his creatures.</p>
