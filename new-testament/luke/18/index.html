	<p><em>The Church is taught to commit the revenge of her persecutions to God, and to pray incessantly, for he no doubt (though in the persecution of Antichrist few will so think) will at length come. (9)&nbsp;We must also pray with humility, because we know not with the Pharisee if we be just, but we know with the Publican that we be sinners. (15)&nbsp;He will have children to be brought to him, and all to be as children. (18)&nbsp;What is to be done to get life everlasting. (22)&nbsp;What also, to get perfection; (28)&nbsp;and what reward they shall have that leave all, yea or any part, for his sake. (31)&nbsp;He foretelleth of his Passion most particularly, (33)&nbsp;and entering into Jericho, cures one blind man.</em></p>

	<p>AND he spoke also a parable to them that it behoveth <sup><a id="lk18-fn-a-t" href="#lk18-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> always to pray, and not to be weary, <sup>2</sup>saying: There was a certain judge in a certain city, which feared not God, and of man made no account. <sup>3</sup>And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying, Revenge me of mine adversary. <sup>4</sup>And he would not of a long time. But afterward he said within himself, Although I fear not God, nor make account of man, <sup>5</sup>yet because this widow is importune upon me, I will revenge her, lest at the last she come and defame me. <sup>6</sup>And our Lord said: Hear what the judge of iniquity sayeth. <sup>7</sup>And will not God revenge his elect that cry to him day and night; and will he have patience in them? <sup>8</sup>I say to you that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man coming, <a id="lk18-anno-8-t" href="#lk18-anno-8" class="annotation">•</a> shall he find trow you, faith in the earth?</p>

	<p><sup>9</sup>And he said also to certain that trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, this parable: <sup>10</sup>Two men went up into the Temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican. <sup>11</sup>The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself, God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, advouterers, as also this Publican. <sup>12</sup> <sup><a id="lk18-fn-b-t" href="#lk18-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> I fast twice in a week, I give tithes of all that I possess. <sup>13</sup>And the Publican standing afar off would not so much as lift up his eyes toward Heaven; but he <sup><a id="lk18-fn-c-t" href="#lk18-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> knocked his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. <sup>14</sup>I say to you, this man went down into his house justified more than he: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.</p>

	<p><sup>15</sup>And they brought unto him infants also, that he might touch them. Which thing when the Disciples saw, they rebuked them. <sup>16</sup>But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> calling them together, said: Suffer children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for the Kingdom of Heaven is for such. <sup>17</sup>Amen I say to you, Whosoever receiveth not the Kingdom of God <sup><a id="lk18-fn-d-t" href="#lk18-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> as a child, shall not enter into it.</p>

	<p><sup>18</sup> * And a certain Prince asked him, saying: Good Master, by doing what, shall I possess everlasting life? <sup>19</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: Why doest thou call me good? None is good but only God. <sup>20</sup>Thou knowest <sup><a id="lk18-fn-e-t" href="#lk18-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> the commandments: <em>Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit advoutry, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and mother</em>. <sup>21</sup>Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth. <sup>22</sup>Which <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> hearing, said to him: Yet one thing thou lackest, <sup><a id="lk18-fn-f-t" href="#lk18-fn-f" class=afn>[f]</a></sup> Sell all that ever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven, and come, follow me. <sup>23</sup>He hearing these things, was struck sad: because he was very rich. <sup>24</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> seeing him struck sad, said: How hardly shall they that have money enter into the Kingdom of God? <sup>25</sup>For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. <sup>26</sup>And they that heard, said: And who can be saved? <sup>27</sup>He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God. <sup>28</sup>And Peter said: Lo, we have left all things, and have followed thee. <sup>29</sup>Who said to them: Amen I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or <sup><a id="lk18-fn-g-t" href="#lk18-fn-g" class=afn>[g]</a></sup> wife, or children for the Kingdom of God, <sup>30</sup>and shall not receive much more in this time, and in the world to come <sup><a id="lk18-fn-h-t" href="#lk18-fn-h" class=afn>[h]</a></sup> life everlasting.</p>

	<p><sup>31</sup> * And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> took the Twelve, and said to them: Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be consumate which were written by the Prophets of the Son of man. <sup>32</sup>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon, <sup>33</sup>and after they have scourged him, they will kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. <sup>34</sup>And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.</p>

	<p><sup>35</sup>And it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way, begging. <sup>36</sup>And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this should be. <sup>37</sup>And they told him that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> of Nazareth passed by. <sup>38</sup>And he cried saying: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> son of David, have mercy upon me. <sup>39</sup>And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace. But he cried much more: Son of David have mercy upon me. <sup>40</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> standing commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him, <sup>41</sup>saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see. <sup>42</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: Do thou see; thy faith hath made thee whole. <sup>43</sup>And forthwith he saw, and followed him, magnifying God. And all the people as they saw it, gave praise to God.</p>

To whom we answer as St. Jerom and St. Augustin answered them, that Christ saith not that there should be no faith left in earth: but by this manner of speech insinuateth, that at the later day in the great persecution of Antichrist faith should be more rare, and the faithful among so many wicked not so notorious: specially that perfect faith containing devotion, trust, and affection toward God, which our Master so praised in certain upon whom he wrought miracles, and by force whereof mountains might be moved, which is rare even when the Church flourisheth most.</p>
