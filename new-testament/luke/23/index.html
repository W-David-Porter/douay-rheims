<div class=verse>
	<p>AND all the multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate. <sup>2</sup>And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man subverting our Nation, and prohibiting to give tributes to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the King. <sup>3</sup>And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the King of the Jews? But he answering said: Thou sayest. <sup>4</sup>And Pilate said to the chief Priests and multitudes: I find no cause in this man. <sup>5</sup>But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth the people teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee even hither. <sup>6</sup>But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee. <sup>7</sup>And when he understood that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him back to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem in those days.</p>

	<p><sup>8</sup>And Herod seeing <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, was very glad, for he was desirous of a long time to see him, for because he heard many things of him: and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him. <sup>9</sup>And he asked him in many words. But he answered him nothing. <sup>10</sup>And there stood the chief Priests and the Scribes constantly accusing him. <sup>11</sup>And Herod with his army set him at nought: and he mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate. <sup>12</sup>And Herod and Pilate were made friends that day. For before they were enemies one to another.</p>

	<p><sup>13</sup>And Pilate calling together the chief Priests and Magistrates, and the people, <sup>14</sup>said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as averting the People, and behold I examining him before you, have found no cause in this man of those things, wherein you accuse him. <sup>15</sup>No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him. <sup>16</sup>I will chasten him therefore and dismiss him.</p>

	<p><sup>17</sup>And he of necessity had to release unto them upon the feast day, one. <sup>18</sup>But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Dispatch him, and release us Barabbas. <sup>19</sup>Who was for a certain sedition made in the city and murder, cast into prison. <sup>20</sup>And Pilate again spoke to them, desirous to release <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>. <sup>21</sup>But they cried again, saying: Crucify, crucify him. <sup>22</sup>And he the third time said to them: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will correct him therefore and let him go. <sup>23</sup>But they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed. <sup>24</sup>And Pilate adjudged their petition to be done. <sup>25</sup>And he released unto them him that for murder and sedition had been cast into prison, whom they demanded; but <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> he delivered to their pleasure.</p>

	<p><sup>26</sup>And when they led him, they took one Simon of Cyrene coming from the country; and they laid the Cross upon him to carry after <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>. <sup>27</sup>And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women which bewailed and lamented him. <sup>28</sup>But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not upon me, but weep upon yourselves, and upon your children. <sup>29</sup>For behold the days shall come, wherein they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not born, and the paps that have not given suck. <sup>30</sup><em>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us.</em> <sup>31</sup>For if in the green wood they do these things, in the dry what shall be done?</p>

	<p><sup>32</sup>And there were led also other two malefactors with him, to be executed. <sup>33</sup>And after they came to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him; and the thieves, one on the right hand and the other on the left. <sup>34</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said: Father, <a id="lk23-anno-34-t" href="#lk23-anno-34" class="annotation">•</a> forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they dividing his garments, did cast lots.</p>

	<p><sup>35</sup>And the people stood `beholding, and the Princes with them derided him, saying: Others he hath saved, let him save himself, if this be Christ, the elect of God. <sup>36</sup>And the soldiers also mocked him coming to him, and offering him vinegar, <sup>37</sup>saying: If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself. <sup>38</sup>And there was also a superscription written over him in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew letters: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">This is the king of the Jews</span>. <sup>39</sup>And one of those thieves that were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself, and us. <sup>40</sup>But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither doest thou fear God, where as thou art in the same damnation? <sup>41</sup>And we indeed justly, for we receive worthy of our doings: but this man hath done no evil. <sup>42</sup>And he said to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy Kingdom. <sup>43</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: Amen I say to thee; this day thou shalt be with me <a id="lk23-anno-43-t" href="#lk23-anno-43" class="annotation">•</a> in Paradise.</p>

	<p><sup>44</sup>And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was made darkness upon the whole earth until the ninth hour. <sup>45</sup>And the <sup><a id="lk23-fn-a-t" href="#lk23-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> sun was darkened; and the veil of the Temple was rent in the midst. <sup>46</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> crying with a loud voice, said: <em>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit</em>. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.</p>

	<p><sup>47</sup>And the Centurion seeing that which was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this man was just. <sup>48</sup>And all the multitude of them that were present together at that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned knocking their breasts. <sup>49</sup>And all his acquaintance stood afar off, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, seeing these things.</p>

	<p><sup>50</sup> * And behold a man named Joseph, which was a Senator, a good man and a just. <sup>51</sup>He had not consented to their council and doings, of Arimathaea a city of Jewry, who also himself expected the Kingdom of God. <sup>52</sup>This man came to Pilate, and asked the body of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>. <sup>53</sup>And taking it down, wrapped it in sindon, and laid him in a monument hewed of stone, <a id="lk23-anno-53-t" href="#lk23-anno-53" class="annotation">•</a> wherein never yet any man had been laid. <sup>54</sup>And it was the day of Parasceve, and the Sabboth drew near. <sup>55</sup>And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after <a id="lk23-anno-55-t" href="#lk23-anno-55" class="annotation">•</a> saw the monument, and how his body was laid. <sup>59</sup>And returning they prepared spices and ointments: and on the Sabboth they rested according to the commandment.</p>

	<p><a id="lk23-anno-34" href="#lk23-anno-34-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 34. <em>Forgive them.</em>) A perfect example of charity in our Saviour praying for his crucifiers, which the first martyr St. Steven did follow, <em>Act. 7</em>: and the prayers of both were heard: Christ’s prayer taking effect in the Centurion and others, Steven’s in Paul.</p>

	<p><a id="lk23-anno-43" href="#lk23-anno-43-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 43. <em>In Paradise.</em>) Thou maist not hereupon defer thy conversion or amendment, presuming of grace at the last hour of thy life, not look to have salvation by faith and confession of Christ without good works, nor to go straight to Heaven without satisfaction, penance, or punishment for thy former sins and life ill spent; nor challenge security and certain knowledge of thy salvation. For this good thief’s case is not common but a rare example of mercy and prerogative. But for the first point, learn only not to despair, though thou hast been ill to the last moment of thy life. For the second, that faith, hope, and charity, repentance, and good will be sufficient, and good works not required, where for want of time and opportunity they cannot be had. For the third, that Christ gave to this happy man for his zealous confession of him and reprehending his fellow not only remission of his sins, but also by extraordinary grace, a pardon of all penance and satisfaction due either in this life or the next for the same: even as the holy Church by his example and commission giveth pardons also to some of her zealous children of all punishment due for their offences, and such go straight to Heaven. Lastly, that every one hath not a revelation of his salvation as this man had, and therefore can not be so sure as he was.</p>

	<p><a id="lk23-anno-53" href="#lk23-anno-53-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 53. <em>Wherein never.</em>) As in the womb of Mary none was conceived before nor after him, so in this monument none was laid before nor after him: which prerogative (no doubt) was of God’s providence; this Joseph no less abstaining afterward to be buried in it, than the other Joseph from copulation with the mother of our Lord. <em>St. Augustine.</em></p>

	<p><a id="lk23-anno-55" href="#lk23-anno-55-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 55. <em>Saw the monument.</em>) These good women of great devotion observed the sepulchre for the honour of the holy body. Whereupon the devotion of faithful folk watching and visiting on Good-Friday and easter eve the sepulchre made in every Church for memory of our Lord’s burial, is exceeding good and godly, specially the Bl. Sacrament for more signification sake being present in the same Sepulchre.</p>
