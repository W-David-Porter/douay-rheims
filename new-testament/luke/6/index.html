	<p><em>For reproving by Scripture and miracle (as also by reason) the Pharisees blindness about the observation of the Sabboth, (11)&nbsp;they seek his death. (12)&nbsp;Having in the mountain prayed all night, he chooseth twelve Apostles, (17)&nbsp;and after many miracles upon the diseased, (20)&nbsp;he maketh a sermon to his Disciples before the people: proposing heaven to such as will suffer for him, (24)&nbsp;and woe to such as will not. (27)&nbsp;Yet with all exhorting to do good even to our enemies also. (39)&nbsp;And that the Masters must first mend themselves. (46)&nbsp;Finally, to do good works, because only faith will not suffice.</em></p>

<div class=verse>
	<p>AND it came to pass on the <sup><a id="lk6-fn-a-t" href="#lk6-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> Sabboth second-first, when he passed through the corn, his Disciples did pluck the ears, and did eat rubbing them with their hands. <sup>2</sup>And certain of the Pharisees said to them: Why do you that which is not lawful on the Sabboths? <sup>3</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering them, said: <a id="lk6-anno-3-t" href="#lk6-anno-3" class="annotation">•</a> Neither this have you read which David did, when himself was a hungered and they that were with him: <sup>4</sup> * how he entered into the house of God, and took the loaves of Proposition, and did eat, and gave to them that were with him, which it is not lawful to eat * but only for Priests? <sup>5</sup>And he said to them: That the Son of man is Lord of the Sabboth also.</p>

	<p><sup>6</sup>And it came to pass on another Sabboth also, that he entered into the Synagogue, and taught. * And there was a man, and his right hand was withered. <sup>7</sup>And the Scribes and Pharisees watched if he would cure on the Sabboth; that they might find how to accuse him. <sup>8</sup>But he knew their cogitations: and he said to the man that had the withered hand: Arise, and stand forth into the midst. And rising he stood. <sup>9</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: I ask you, if it be lawful on the Sabboths to do well or ill; to <a id="lk6-anno-9-t" href="#lk6-anno-9" class="annotation">•</a> save a soul or to destroy? <sup>10</sup>And looking about upon them all, he said to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored. <sup>11</sup>And they were replenished with madness; and they communed one with another what they might do to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>.</p>

	<p><sup>12</sup>And it came to pass in those days, he went forth into the mountain to pray, and he passed <a id="lk6-anno-12-t" href="#lk6-anno-12" class="annotation">•</a> the whole night in the prayer of God. <sup>13</sup> * And when day was come, he called his Disciples; and he chose twelve of them(<a id="lk6-anno-13-t" href="#lk6-anno-13" class="annotation">•</a> whom also he named <em>Apostles</em>). <sup>14</sup> <a id="lk6-anno-14-t" href="#lk6-anno-14" class="annotation">•</a> Simon whom he surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philippe and Bartholomew, <sup>15</sup>Matthew and Thomas, James of Alphaeus and Symon that is called Zelotes, <sup>16</sup>and Jude of James, and Judas Iscariot which was the traitor. <sup>17</sup>And descending with them he stood in a plain place, and the multitude of his Disciples, and a very great company of people from all Jewry and Jerusalem, and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon, <sup>18</sup>which were come to hear him, and to be healed of their maladies. And they that were vexed of unclean Spirits, were cured. <sup>19</sup>And all the multitude <sup><a id="lk6-fn-b-t" href="#lk6-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> sought to touch him, because virtue went forth from him, and healed all. <sup>20</sup>And he lifting up his eyes upon his Disciples, said:</p>

	<p>* Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the Kingdom of God. <sup>21</sup>Blessed are you that now are a hungered: because you shall be filled. Blessed are you that now do weep: because you shall laugh. <sup>22</sup>Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, and upbraid you, and abandon your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake. <sup>23</sup> <a id="lk6-anno-23-t" href="#lk6-anno-23" class="annotation">•</a> Be glad in that day and rejoice; for behold, your reward is much in Heaven. For according to these things did their Fathers to the Prophets. <sup>24</sup>But woe to you that are rich: because you have your consolation. <sup>25</sup>Woe to you that are filled: because you shall be hungry. Woe to you that now do laugh: because you shall mourn and weep. <sup>26</sup>Woe, when all men <a id="lk6-anno-26-t" href="#lk6-anno-26" class="annotation">•</a> shall bless you: For according to these things did their Fathers to the false-Prophets.</p>

	<p><sup>27</sup>But to you I say that do hear: Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you. <sup>28</sup>Bless them that curse you, and pray for them that calumniate you. <sup>29</sup>And he that striketh thee on the cheek, offer also the other. And from him that taketh away from thee thy robe, prohibit not thy coat also. <sup>30</sup>And <sup><a id="lk6-fn-c-t" href="#lk6-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> to every one that asketh thee, give, and of him that taketh away the things that are thine, ask not again. <sup>31</sup>And according as you will that men do to you, do you also to them in like manner. <sup>32</sup>And if you love them that love you, what thanks is to you? for sinners also love those that love them. <sup>33</sup>And if ye do good to them that do you good: what thanks is to you? for sinners also do this. <sup>34</sup>And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive; what thanks is to you? for sinners also lend unto sinners, for to receive as much. <sup>35</sup>But love ye your enemies; do good and <a id="lk6-anno-35-t" href="#lk6-anno-35" class="annotation">•</a> lend, hoping for nothing thereby: and your reward shall be much, and you shall be the Sons of the Highest, because himself is beneficial upon the unkind and the evil. <sup>36</sup>Be ye therefore merciful as also your Father is merciful. <sup>37</sup>Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. <sup>38</sup>Give, and there shall be given to you. Good measure and pressed down and shaken together and running over shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you do mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>

	<p><sup>39</sup>And he said to them a similitude also: Can the blind lead the blind? do not both fall into the ditch? <sup>40</sup>The Disciple is not above his Master: but every one shall be perfect, if he be as his Master. <sup>41</sup>And why seest thou the mote in thy brother’s eye: but the beam that is in thine own eye thou considerest not? <sup>42</sup>Or how canst thou say to thy brother: Brother, let me cast out the mote out of thine eye: thyself not seeing the beam in thine own eye? Hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to take forth the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</p>

	<p><sup>43</sup>For there is no good tree that yieldeth evil fruits; nor evil tree, that yieldeth good fruit. <sup>44</sup>For every tree is known by his fruit. For neither do they gather figs of thorns; neither of a bush do they gather the grape. <sup>45</sup>The good man of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good; and the evil man of the ill treasure bringeth forth evil. For of the aboundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</p>

	<p><sup>46</sup>And why call you me, Lord, Lord: and do not the things which I say? <sup>47</sup>Every one that cometh to me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like. <sup>48</sup>He is like to a man <a id="lk6-fn-d-t" href="#lk6-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> building a house, that digged deep, and laid the foundation upon a rock. And when an inundation rose, the river beat against that house, and it could not move it; for it was founded upon a rock. <sup>49</sup>But he that heareth, and doeth not; is like to a man building his house upon the earth without a foundation: against the which the river did beat; and incontinent it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. VI.</h4>
	<p><a id="lk6-anno-3" href="#lk6-anno-3-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 3. <em>Neither this have you read</em>.) The Scribes and Pharisees boasted most of their knowledge of the Scripture; but our Saviour often showeth their great ignorance. Even so the Heretics that nowadays vaunt most of the Scriptures and of their understanding of them, may soon be proved to understand little or nothing.</p>

	<p><a id="lk6-anno-9" href="#lk6-anno-9-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 9. <em>Save a soul.</em>) Hereby it seemeth that Christ (as at other times lightly always) did not only heal this man in body, but of some correspondent disease in his soul.</p>

	<p><a id="lk6-anno-12" href="#lk6-anno-12-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 12. <em>The whole night</em>.) Our Saviour instantly prayed, alone in the mount without door, all night long, as a preparation to the designment of his Apostles the day after: to give example to the Church of praying instantly when Priests are to be ordered, and a lesson to us all what we should do for our own necessities, when Christ did so for other men’s.</p>

	<p><a id="lk6-anno-13" href="#lk6-anno-13-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 13. <em>Whom he named Apostles</em>.) Here it is to be noted against our Adversaries that deceitfully measure to the simple the whole nature and quality of certain sacred functions, by the primitive signification and compass of the names or words whereby they be called; with whom as a Priest is but an elder, and a Bishop, a watchman or Superintendent, so an Apostle is nothing but a Legate or Messenger, and therefore (as they argue) * can make no Laws nor prescribe or teach anything not expressed in his <em>mandatum</em>. Know therefore against such deceivers, that such things are not to be ruled by the vulgar signification of the word or calling, but by use and application of the holy writers, and in this point by Christ’s own express imposition. And so this word <em>Apostle</em>, is a calling of Office, government, authority, and most high dignity given by our Master, specially to the College of the Twelve: whom he endowed above that which the vulgar etymology of their name requireth, with power to bind and loose, to punish and pardon, to teach and rule his Church. Out of which room and dignity, (which is called in the Psalm and in the Acts a Bishopric) when Judas fell, Matthias was chosen to supply it, and was numbered among the rest, who were as founders or foundations of our religion, as the Apostle termeth them. Therefore to that college this name agreeth by special imposition and prerogative, though afterward it was by use of the Scriptures extended to St. Paul and St. Barnabas, and sometimes to the Apostles’ successors: as also (by the like use of Scriptures) to the first converters of countries to the faith, or their co-adjutors in that function. In which sense St. Paul challengeth to be the Corinthians’ Apostle, and nameth Epaphroditus the Philippians’ Apostle: as we call St. Gregory and his Disciple St. Augustin, our Apostles of England. In all which taking, it ever signifieth Dignity, Regiment, Paternity, Principality, and Primacy in the Church of God: according to St. Paul I. Cor. 12, <em>He hath placed in his Church, first indeed Apostles &amp;c</em>. Whereby we may see that St. Peter’s dignity was a wonderful eminent Prerogative and Sovereignty, when he was the Head not only of other Christian men, but the Head of all Apostles, yea even of the College of the Twelve. And if our Adversaries list to have learned any profitable lesson by the word Apostle, more profitably and truly they might have gathered, that Christ called these his principal officers, <em>Apostles</em>, or <em>Sent</em>, himself also specially and above all other being <em>Missus</em>, that is, <em>Sent</em>, and called also Apostle in the Scriptures; to warn us by the nature of the word, that none are true Apostles, Pastors, or Preachers, that are not specially sent and called, or that cannot show by whom they be sent, and that all Heretics therefore be rather Apostates than Apostles, for that they be not sent, nor duly called, nor chosen to preach.</p>
	
	<p><a id="lk6-anno-14" href="#lk6-anno-14-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 14. <em>Simon</em>.) Peter in the numbering of the Apostles, always first named and preferred before Andrew his elder brother and senior by calling. <em>See Annot. Mat. 10, 2.</em></p>

	<p><a id="lk6-anno-23" href="#lk6-anno-23-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 23. <em>Be glad</em>.) The common miseries that fall to the true preachers and other Catholic men for Christ’s sake, as poverty, famine, mourning, and persecutions, be indeed the greatest blessing that can be, and are meritorious of the reward of Heaven. Contrarywise, all the felicities of this world without Christ, are indeed nothing but woe, and the entrance to everlasting misery.</p>
	
	<p><a id="lk6-anno-26" href="#lk6-anno-26-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 26. <em>Shall bless you</em>.) This woe pertaineth to the Heretics of our days, that delight to have the People’s praises and blessings and shouts, preaching pleasant things of purpose to their itching ears: as did the False-Prophets, when they were magnified and commended therefore of the carnal Jews.</p>

	<p><a id="lk6-anno-35" href="#lk6-anno-35-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 35. <em>Lend, hoping nothing</em>.) In that we may here seem to be moved to lend to those whom we think not able nor like ever to repay again, it must be holden for a counsel rather than a commandment, except the case of necessity. But it may be taken rather for a precept, wherein usury, that is to say, the expectation not of the money lent, but of vantage for loan, is forbidden: as by other places of Scripture it is condemned, and is a thing against the Law of nature and Nations. And great shame and pity it is, that it should be so much used or suffered among Christians, or so covered and cloaked under the habit of other contracts, as it is.</p>
