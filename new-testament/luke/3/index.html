	<p><em>John, to prepare all to Christ (as Esay had prophesied of him) baptizeth them to penance, (7)&nbsp;insinuating their reprobation, and the Gentiles’ vocation, (10)&nbsp;teaching also and exhorting each sort to do their duty. (15)&nbsp;That himself is not Christ, he showeth by the difference of their two Baptisms: (17)&nbsp;and saith that Christ will also judge his baptized. (19)&nbsp;John’s imprisonment. (21)&nbsp;Christ being himself also baptized of John, hath testimony from Heaven (23)&nbsp;as he whose Generation reduceth us again to God.</em></p>

	<p>AND in the fifteenth year of the empire of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being Governor of Jewry, and Herod being Tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother Tetrarch of Iturea and the country Trachonitis, and Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilina,  <sup>2</sup>under the high Priests Annas and Caiphas: the Word of our Lord was made upon John the son of Zachary, in the desert. <sup>3</sup>And * he came into all the country of Jordan, preaching the Baptism of <sup><a id="lk3-fn-a-t" href="#lk3-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> penance unto remission of sins; as it is written in the book of the sayings of Esay the Prophet: <sup>4</sup><em>A voice of one crying in the desert; prepare the way of our Lord, make straight his paths</em>. <sup>5</sup><em>Every valley shall be filled: and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and crooked things shall become straight; and rough ways, plain</em>: <sup>6</sup><em>and all flesh shall see the SALVATION of God</em>.</p>

	<p><sup>7</sup>He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized of him: * Ye vipers’ broods, who hath showed you to flee from the wrath to come? <sup>8</sup>Yield therefore <sup><a id="lk3-fn-b-t" href="#lk3-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> fruits worthy of penance; and do ye not begin to say, we have Abraham, to our father. For I tell you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. <sup>9</sup>For now the axe is put to the root of the trees. <sup><a id="lk3-fn-c-t" href="#lk3-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> Every tree therefore that yieldeth not good fruit, ′ shall be cut down, and cast into fire. <sup>10</sup>And the multitudes asked him, saying: What shall we do then? <sup>11</sup>And he answering, said unto them: <sup><a id="lk3-fn-d-t" href="#lk3-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> He that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath not; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. <sup>12</sup>And the Publicans also came to be baptized, and said to him: Maister, what shall we do? <sup>13</sup>But he said to them: Do nothing more than that which is appointed you. <sup>14</sup>And the soldiers also asked him, saying: What shall we also do? And he said to them: Vex not, neither calumniate any man; and be content with your stipends.</p>

	<p><sup>15</sup>And <sup><a id="lk3-fn-e-t" href="#lk3-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> the People imagining, and all men thinking in their hearts of John, lest perhaps he were Christ: <sup>16</sup>John answered, saying unto all: * I indeed baptize you with water; <sup><a id="lk3-fn-f-t" href="#lk3-fn-f" class=afn>[f]</a></sup> but there ′ shall come a mightier than I, whose latchet of his shoes I am not worthy to loose; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire: <sup>17</sup>whose fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor; and will gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</p>

	<p><sup>18</sup>Many other things also exhorting did he evangelise to the People.</p>

	<p><sup>19</sup> * And Herod the Tetrarch, when he was rebuked of him for Herodias his ′ brother’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod did: <sup>20</sup> <a id="lk3-anno-20-t" href="#lk3-anno-20" class="annotation">•</a> he added this also above all, and shut up John into prison. <sup>21</sup> * And it came to pass when all the People was baptized, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> also being baptized and praying, Heaven was opened: <sup>22</sup>and the Holy Ghost descended in corporal shape as a dove upon him: and a voice from Heaven was made: Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased. <sup>23</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> himself was beginning to be about thirty years old: as it was thought, the son of Joseph, who was <a id="lk3-anno-23-t" href="#lk3-anno-23" class="annotation">•</a> of Heli, <sup>24</sup>who was of Matthat, who was of Levi, who was of Melchi, who was of Janne, who was of Joseph, <sup>25</sup>who was of Matthathias, who was of Amos, who was of Naum, who was of Hesli, who was of Nagge, <sup>26</sup>who was of Mahath, who was of Matthathias, who was of Semei, who was of Joseph, who was of Juda, <sup>27</sup>who was of Johanna, who was of Resa, who was of Zorobabel, who was of Salathiel, who was of Neri, <sup>28</sup>who was of Melchi, who was of Addi, who was of Cosam,

The fault of Princes and other great men, that can not only not abide to hear their faults, but also punish by death or imprisonment such as reprehend them for the same (specially if they warn them, as Prophets and Priests do, from God) is exceeding great.</p>

	<p><a id="lk3-anno-23" href="#lk3-anno-23-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 23. <em>Of Heli</em>.) Whereas in St. Matthew, Jacob is father to Joseph, and here Heli, the case was thus. Mathan (named in St. Matthew) of his wife called Escha begat Jacob: and after his death, Melchi (named here in St. Luke) of the same woman begat Heli: so that Jacob and Heli were brethren of one mother. This Heli therefore marrying and dying without issue: Jacob his brother, according to the Law married his wife, and begat Joseph, and so raised up seed to his brother Heli. Whereby it came to pass, that Jacob was the natural father of Joseph which as (St. Matthew saith) begat him: and Heli was his legal father according to the Law, as St. Luke signifieth. <em>Euseb. lib. 1 Ecc. Hist. ch. 7 Jero. in ch. 1 Mat. Aug. lib. 2 ch. 2. 3 de cons. Evang.</em></p>
