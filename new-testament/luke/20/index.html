	<p><em>To the Jews he avoucheth his power by the witness of John who was a man sent of God. (9)&nbsp;And foretelleth in a parable their reprobation most worthy (with the vocation of the Gentiles in their place) (17)&nbsp;and consequently their irreparable damnation that shall ensue thereof. (20)&nbsp;He defeateth their snare about paying tribute to Caesar: (27)&nbsp;he answereth also the invention of the Sadducees against the Resurrection. (40)&nbsp;And so having put them all to silence, (41)&nbsp;he turneth and poseth them, because they imagined that Christ should be no more but a man: (45)&nbsp;bidding all to beware of the Scribes (authors of the Jews’ schism from him) being ambitious and hypocrites.</em></p>

<div class=verse>
	<p>AND it came to pass in one of the days, when he was teaching the people in the temple and evangelising, the chief Priests and the Scribes with the Ancients assembled, <sup>2</sup>and spoke saying to him: <sup><a id="lk20-fn-a-t" href="#lk20-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> Tell us, in what power doest thou these things? or, who is he that hath given thee this power? <sup>3</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering, said to them: I also will ask you one word. Answer me. <sup>4</sup>The Baptism of John was it from Heaven, or of men? <sup>5</sup>But they thought within themselves, saying: That if we say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him? <sup>6</sup>But if we say, of men; the whole people will stone us; for they are certain that John is a Prophet. <sup>7</sup>And they answered that they knew not whence it was. <sup>8</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: Neither do I tell you in what power I do these things.</p>

	<p><sup>9</sup>And he began to say to the people this parable, * A certain <sup><a id="lk20-fn-b-t" href="#lk20-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen: and he was from home a long time. <sup>10</sup>And in time he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. Who beating him sent him away empty. <sup>11</sup>And again he sent another servant. But they beating him also and reproachfully abusing him, sent him away empty. <sup>12</sup>And again he sent the third; who wounding him also, cast him out. <sup>13</sup>And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps when they shall see him, they will reverence him. <sup>14</sup>Whom when the husbandmen saw, they thought within themselves, saying, This is the heir, let us kill him, that the heritage may be ours. <sup>15</sup>And casting him forth out of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do to them? <sup>16</sup>He will come, and will destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. Which they hearing, said to him: God forbid. <sup>17</sup>But he beholding them said: What is this then that is written, <em>The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become into the head of the corner</em>? <sup>18</sup>Every one that falleth upon this stone, shall be quashed; and upon whom it shall fall, it shall break him to powder. <sup>19</sup>And the chief Priests and Scribes sought to lay hands upon him that hour; and they feared the people, for they knew that he spoke this similitude to them.</p>

	<p>* <sup>20</sup>And watching, they sent spies which should feign themselves just: that they might take him in his talk, and deliver him to the principality and power of the President. <sup>21</sup>And they asked him, saying: Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly; and thou doest not accept person, but teachest the way of God in truth. <sup>22</sup>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no? <sup>23</sup>But considering their guile, he said to them: Why tempt you me? <sup>24</sup>Show me a penny. Whose image hath it and inscription? They answering said: Caesar’s. <sup>25</sup>And he said to them: Render therefore the things that are Caesar’s, <sup><a id="lk20-fn-c-t" href="#lk20-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> to Caesar; and the things that are God’s, to God. <sup>26</sup>And they could not reprehend his word before the people: and marvelling at his answer, they held their peace. <sup>27</sup> * And there came certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is a resurrection, and they asked him, <sup>28</sup>saying: Master, Moyses gave us in writing, * If a man’s brother die having a wife, and he have no children, that his brother take her to wife, and raise up seed to his brother. <sup>29</sup>There were therefore seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and died without children. <sup>30</sup>And the next took her, and he died without child. <sup>31</sup>And the third took her. In like manner also all the seven, and they left no seed, and died. <sup>32</sup>Last of all the woman died also. <sup>33</sup>In the resurrection therefore, whose wife shall she be of them? Sithens the seven had her to wife. <sup>34</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage; <sup>35</sup>but they that <a id="lk20-anno-35-t" href="#lk20-anno-35" class="annotation">•</a> shall be <sup><a id="lk20-fn-d-t" href="#lk20-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> counted worthy of that world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor take wives; <sup>36</sup>neither can they die any more, for they are <a id="lk20-anno-36-t" href="#lk20-anno-36" class="annotation">•</a> equal to Angels; and they are the sons of God, seeing they are the sons of the resurrection. <sup>37</sup>But that the dead rise again, Moyses also showed, beside the bush, as he calleth the Lord: <em>The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob</em>. <sup>38</sup>For God is not of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him. <sup>39</sup>And certain of the Scribes answering, said to him: Master, thou hast said well. <sup>40</sup>And further they durst not ask him anything.</p>

	<p><sup>41</sup>But he said to them: * How say they that Christ is the son of David, <sup>42</sup>and David himself saith in the book of Psalms, <em>The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand</em>, <sup>43</sup><em>till I put thine enemies, the footstool of thy feet</em>? <sup>44</sup>David then calleth him Lord; and how is he his son?</p>

	<p><sup>45</sup>And all the people hearing him, he said to his Disciples: <sup>46</sup>Beware of the Scribes, that will walk in robes, and love salutations in the market-place, and the first chairs in the synagogues, and the chief rooms in feasts. <sup>47</sup>Which devour widow’s houses: feigning long prayer. These shall receive greater damnation.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. XX.</h4>
	<p><a id="lk20-anno-35" href="#lk20-anno-35-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 35. <em>Shall be counted worthy.</em>) This truth and Speech that good men be worthy of Heaven, is according to the Scriptures, and signifieth that man’s works done by Christ’s grace do condignly or worthily deserve eternal joy: As Sap. 3. <em>God proved them, and found them worthy of himself</em>: and Mat. 10. <em>He that loveth his father more than me, is not worthy of me</em>. and Colos. 1. <em>That you may walk worthy of God</em>: and most plainly Apoc. 3. <em>They shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy</em>: as of Christ (c. 1) <em>Thou art worthy, o Lord, to receive glory &amp;c</em>. And that, to be counted worthy, and to be worthy, is here all one, it is plain, the Greek word, which St. Paul useth so, as the Adversaries’ own English Testaments do testify, reading thus Hebrew 10. <em>Of how much sorer punishment shall he be worthy, which &amp;c</em>. And it must needs signify, because men for sins are not only counted, but are indeed worthy of punishment, as themselves do grant. They do greatly therefore forget themselves, and are ignorant in the Scriptures, and know not the force nor the value of the grace of God, which doth not only make our labours grateful to God, but worthy of the reward which he hath provided for such as love him. See the Annot. <em>2 Thess. 1, 5.</em></p>

	<p><a id="lk20-anno-36" href="#lk20-anno-36-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 36. <em>.Equal to Angels</em>) Saints of our kind, now in their souls, and after their resurrection in body and soul together, shall be in all things equal to Angels: and for degree of bliss, many Saints of greater merit shall be above diverse Angels: as St. John Baptist, the Apostles, and others, and our Bl. Lady above all the orders of holy Spirits in dignity and bliss: and no marvel, our nature by Christ being so highly exalted above all Angels.</p>
