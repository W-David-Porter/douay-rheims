	<p><em>Being now come to the place of his Passion, he entereth with triumph as their Christ. (12) He curseth that fruitless leafy tree. (15) He showeth his zeal for the house of God: for which the Rulers seek his destruction. (24) He exhorteth his Disciples to steadfastness of faith, and to forgive their enemies. (27) He avoucheth his power by the witness of John who was a man sent of God.</em></p>

<div class=verse>
	<p>AND when they came nigh unto Jerusalem and Bethania to Mount-olivet, he sendeth two of his Disciples, <sup>2</sup>and says to them: Go into the town that is against you, and immediately entering in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which no man yet hath sat: loose him, and bring him. <sup>3</sup>And if any man shall say to you: What do you? say that he is needful for our Lord: and incontinent he will send him hither. <sup>4</sup>And going their ways, they found the colt tied before the gate without in the meeting of two ways: and they loose him. <sup>5</sup>And certain of them that stood there, said to them: What do you loosing the colt? <sup>6</sup>Who said to them as <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> had commanded them; and they did let him go with them. <sup>7</sup>And they brought the colt to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>; and they lay their garments upon him, and he sat upon him. <sup>8</sup>And <sup><a id="mk11-fn-a-t" href="#mk11-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> many spread their garments in the way: and others did cut boughs from the trees, and strawed them in the way. <sup>9</sup>And they that went before and they that followed, cried saying, <em>Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of our Lord</em>. <sup>10</sup><em>Blessed is the Kingdom of our father David that cometh, Hosanna in the highest</em>. <sup>11</sup>And he entered Jerusalem into the temple; and having viewed all things round about, when now the evening hour was come, he went forth into Bethania with the Twelve.</p>

	<p><sup>12</sup>And the next day when they departed from Bethania, he was an hungered. <sup>13</sup>And * when he had seen afar off a figtree having leaves, he came if happily he could find any thing on it. And when he was come to it, he found nothing but leaves. For it was not the time for figs. <sup>14</sup>And answering he said to it: Now no man eat fruit of thee any more for ever. And his Disciples heard it. <sup>15</sup>And they come to Jerusalem.</p>

	<p>And * when he was entered into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and the tables of the bankers, and the chairs of them that sold pigeons he overthrew. <sup>16</sup>And he suffered not that any man should carry a <a id="mk11-anno-16-t" href="#mk11-anno-16" class="annotation">•</a> vessel through the temple; <sup>17</sup>And he taught, saying to them; Is it not written, <em>That my house shall be called the house of prayer to all Nations? But you have made it</em> <a id="mk11-anno-17-t" href="#mk11-anno-17" class="annotation">•</a> <em>a den of thieves.</em> <sup>18</sup>Which when the chief Priests and the Scribes had heard, they sought how they might destroy him. For they were afraid of him, because the whole multitude was in admiration upon his doctrine. <sup>19</sup>And when evening was come, he went forth out of the city.</p>

	<p><sup>20</sup>And </em>* when they passed by in the morning, they saw the figtree withered from the roots. <sup>21</sup>And Peter remembering, said to him: Rabbi, behold the figtree that thou didst curse, is withered. <sup>22 b</sup>  And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering says to them: Have <sup><a id="mk11-fn-b-t" href="#mk11-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> faith of God. <sup>23</sup>Amen I say to you, that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be taken up and be cast into the sea, and shall not stagger in his heart, but believe that whatsoever he says, shall be done: it shall be done unto him. <sup>24</sup>Therefore I say to you, all things whatsoever you ask, praying, believe that you shall receive, and they shall come unto you. <sup>25</sup>And when you shall stand to pray, forgive if you have ought against any man: that also your Father which is in Heaven, may forgive you your sins: <sup>26</sup> <sup><a id="mk11-fn-c-t" href="#mk11-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> If so be that you will not forgive, neither will your Father that is in Heaven, forgive you your sins. <sup>27</sup>And they come again to Hierusalem.</p>

	<p>And * when he walked in the temple, there come to him the chief Priests and the Scribes and the Ancients, <sup>28</sup>and they say to him: In what power doest thou these things? and who hath given thee this power, that thou shouldest do these things? <sup>29</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering said to them: I also will ask you one word, and answer you me, and I will tell you in what power I do these things. <sup>30</sup>The baptism of John was it from Heaven, or from men? answer me. <sup>31</sup>But they thought with themselves, saying: If we say, from Heaven; he will say, why then did you not believe him? <sup>32</sup>If we say, from men, we fear the people. For all accounted John that he was indeed a Prophet. <sup>33</sup>And they answering say to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> We know not. And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering says to them: Neither do I tell you in what power I do these things.</p>

He could not abide to see the Temple of God profaned, no nor suffered those things to be done in it, which otherwise were not unlawful but honest, if they had been done in due place. How much less can he abide the profaning of Churches now with Heretical service and preaching of heresy and blasphemy?</p>

	<p><a id="mk11-anno-17" href="#mk11-anno-17-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 17. <em>Den of thieves</em>.) If the Temple was then a den of thieves, because of profane and secular merchandise, how much more now, when the house appointed for the Holy Sacrifice and Sacrament of the Body of Christ, is made a den for the Ministers of Calvin’s bread?</p>
