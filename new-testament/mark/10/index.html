	<p><em>He answereth the tempting Pharisees (and again his Disciples afterward) that the case of a man with his wife shall be (as in the first institution) utterly indissoluble. (13) He blesseth children. (17) He showeth what is to be done to get life everlasting: (21) what also for a rich man to be perfect; (28) as also what passing reward they shall have that do so in time of persecution. (32) He revealeth more to his Disciples touching his Passion (35) bidding the two ambitious suitors to think rather of suffering with him: (41) and teaching us in the rest of his Disciples, not to be grieved at our Ecclesiastical Superiors, considering they are (as he was himself) to toil for our salvation. (46) Then going out of Jericho, he giveth sight to a blind man.</em></p>

    <p></em>AND rising up thence, he cometh into the coasts of Jewry beyond Jordan: and the multitudes assemble again unto him. And as he was accustomed, again he taught them. <sup>2</sup>And the Pharisees coming near, asked him: Is it lawful for a man to dismiss his wife? tempting him. <sup>3</sup>But he answering, said to them: What did Moyses command you? <sup>4</sup>Who said: * Moyses <a id="mk10-anno-4-t" href="#mk10-anno-4" class="annotation">•</a> permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to dismiss her. <sup>5</sup>To whom <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering, said: For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. <sup>6</sup>But from the beginning of the creation * God made them male and female. <sup>7</sup>For this cause, * man shall leave his father and mother; and shall cleave to his wife. <sup>8</sup>And they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. <sup>9</sup>That therefore which God hath joined together, <sup><a id="mk10-fn-a-t" href="#mk10-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> let no man separate.</p>
    
    <p><sup>10</sup>And * in the house again his Disciples asked him of the same thing. <sup>11</sup>And he says to them: Whosoever dismisseth his wife and <a id="mk10-anno-11-t" href="#mk10-anno-11" class="annotation">•</a> marrieth another: committeth advoutry upon her. <sup>12</sup>And if the wife dismiss her husband, and marry another, she committeth advoutry.</p>
    
    <p><sup>13</sup>And *<sup>a</sup> they offered to him young children, that he might touch them. And the Disciples threatened those that offered them. <sup>14</sup>Whom when <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saw, he took it ill, and said to them: Suffer the little children to come unto me, and prohibit them not. For the Kingdom of God is for such. <sup>15</sup>Amen I say to you, whosoever receiveth not the Kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter into it. <sup>16</sup>And embracing them, and <sup><a id="mk10-fn-b-t" href="#mk10-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> imposing his hands upon them, he blessed them. <sup>17</sup>And when he was gone forth in the way, a certain man running forth and kneeling before him asked him: * Good Master, what shall I do that I may receive life everlasting? <sup>18</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: Why callest thou me good? <a id="mk10-anno-18-t" href="#mk10-anno-18" class="annotation">•</a> None is good but one, God. <sup>19</sup>Thou knowest the <sup><a id="mk10-fn-c-t" href="#mk10-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> commandments, * <em>Commit not advoutry, Kill not, Steal not, Bear not false witness, do not fraud, Honour thy father and mother</em>. <sup>20</sup>But he answering, said to him: Master all these things I have observed from my youth. <sup>21</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> beholding him, loved him, and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee: <sup><a id="mk10-fn-d-t" href="#mk10-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow me. <sup>22</sup>Who being struck sad at the word, went away sorrowful for he had many possessions. <sup>23</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> looking about, says to his Disciples: How hardly shall they that have money, enter into the Kingdom of God! <sup>24</sup>And the Disciples were astonished at his words. But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> again answering, says to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in money, to enter into the Kingdom of God! <sup>25</sup>It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle’s eye, than for <a id="mk10-anno-25-t" href="#mk10-anno-25" class="annotation">•</a> a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. <sup>26</sup>Who marvelled more, saying to themselves: And who can be saved? <sup>27</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> beholding them says: With men it is impossible; but not with God. For all things are possible with God. <sup>28</sup>And Peter began to say unto him: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee. <sup>29</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering, said: <sup><a id="mk10-fn-e-t" href="#mk10-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> Amen I say to you, there is no man which hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands for me and for the Ghospel, <sup>30</sup>that shall not receive <a id="mk10-anno-30-t" href="#mk10-anno-30" class="annotation">•</a> an hundred times so much now in this time; houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions: and in the world to come life everlasting. <sup>31</sup>But * many that are first, shall be last; and the last, first.</p>
		
	<p><sup>32</sup>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem: and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> went before them, and they were astonished; and following were afraid. And * taking again the Twelve, he began to tell them the things that should befall him. <sup>33</sup>That, behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief Priests, and to the Scribes and Ancients, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles, <sup>34</sup>and they shall mock him, and spit on him, and scourge him, and kill him, and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
		
	<p><sup>35</sup>And * there come to him James and John the sons of Zebedee, saying: Master, we will that what things soever we shall ask, thou do it to us. <sup>36</sup>But he said to them: What will you that I do to you? <sup>37</sup>And they said: Grant to us, that we may sit, one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. <sup>38</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: You wot not what you ask. Can you drink the cup that I drink: or be baptised with the Baptism wherewith I am baptised? <sup>39</sup>But they said to him: We can. And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: The cup indeed which I drink, you shall drink; and with the Baptism wherewith I am baptised, shall you be baptised: <sup>40</sup>but to sit on my right hand or on my left, is not mine to give unto you, but to whom it is prepared. <sup>41</sup>And the ten hearing, began to be displeased at James and John. <sup>42</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> calling them, says to them: * You know that they which seem to rule over the Gentiles, overrule them; and their Princes have power over them. <sup>43</sup>But it is not so in you. But whosoever will be greater, shall be your minister; <sup>44</sup>and whosoever will be first among you, shall be the servant of all. <sup>45</sup>For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.</p>
		
	<p><sup>46.</sup>And </em>* they come to Jericho: and when he departed from Jericho, and his Disciples, and a very great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bar-timaeus the blind man, sat by the way side begging. <sup>47</sup>Who when he had heard, that it is <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> of Nazareth, he began to cry, and to say: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, son of David, have mercy upon me. <sup>48</sup>And many threatened him, to hold his peace. But he cried much more: Son of David, have mercy upon me. <sup>49</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> standing still commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him: Be of better comfort, arise, he calleth thee. <sup>50</sup>Who casting off his garment leapt up, and came to him. <sup>51</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering, said to him: What will thou that I do unto thee? And the blind man said to him: Rabboni, that I may see. <sup>52</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: Go thy ways, thy faith hath made thee safe. And forthwith he saw, and followed him in the way.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. 10.</h4>
	<p><a id="mk10-anno-4" href="#mk10-anno-4-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 4. <em>Permitted</em>.) Some things are permitted, though not approved or allowed, to avoid greater inconveniences. No man may do evil for any cause, but he may permit other men’s evils for diverse causes: as God himself doeth, who can do no evil. So doth the Prince and Common-wealth permit lesser evils to eschew greater, and so may the Holy Church much more (as St. Augustine says she doeth) being placed among much chaff and much cockle, tolerate many things: and yet whatsoever is against faith and good life, she neither approveth, nor dissembleth with silence, nor committeth.</p>
	
	
	<p><a id="mk10-anno-11" href="#mk10-anno-11-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 11. <em>And marrieth another</em>.) That which St. Matthew uttered more obscurely, and is mistaken of some, as though he meant that for fornication a man might put away his wife and marry another, is here by this Evangelist (as also by St. Luke) put out of doubt, generally avouching, that whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth advoutry. <em>Aug. lib. 1 de adult. conjug. 6. 11 and sequentibus.</em></p>
	

	<p><a id="mk10-anno-18" href="#mk10-anno-18-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 18. <em>None is good</em>.) None is entirely, substantially, and of himself good, but God: though by participation of God’s goodness, men are truly also called good.</p>
	
	<p><a id="mk10-anno-25" href="#mk10-anno-25-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 25. <em>A rich man</em>.) He is here called a rich man that hath his confidence (as here is expressed) in his treasure, and had rather forsake his faith and duty to God, than lose them, as all they which live in Schism or Heresy to save their goods.</p>
	
	<p><a id="mk10-anno-30" href="#mk10-anno-30-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 30. <em>A hundred times so much</em>.) Sometime God doth so bless men also in worldly benefits that have forsaken all for him, as St. Gregory, St. Augustine, and St. Paulinus do note: but the principal meaning is, * that he will give to such men in this life aboundance of grace and spiritual comfort and contentation and joy of conscience (as they feel which have experience) the which spiritual gifts exceed the temporal commodities more than a hundredfold. In so much that he that hath fully forsaken but small things for religion, would not forsake religion to have all the world.</p>
