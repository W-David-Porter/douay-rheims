	<p><em>Judas by occasion of Mary Magdalen’s ointment, doth sell him to the Council of the Jews. (12) After the Paschal lamb he giveth them the bread of life ''(Joh. 6.)'' in a mystical Sacrifice or separation of his body and blood (27) and that night, is after his prayer, (43) taken of the Jews’ men, Judas being their Captain: is forsaken of the other eleven for fear: (53) is falsely accused and impiously condemned of the Jews’ Council: (65) and shamefully abused of them: (66) and thrice denied of Peter. All even as the Scriptures and himself had often foretold.</em></p>

<div class=verse>
    <p>AND the Pasch was, and the Azymes after two days: and the chief Priests and the Scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hands on him, and kill him. <sup>2</sup>But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there might be a tumult of the People.</p>
    
    <p><sup>3</sup>And * when he was at Bethania in the house of Simon the Leper, and sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment, of precious spike-nard; and breaking the alabaster-box, she poured it out upon his head. <sup>4</sup>But there were certain that had indignation within themselves, and said: Whereto is <a id="mk14-anno-4-t" href="#mk14-anno-4" class="annotation">•</a> this waste of the ointment made? <sup>5</sup>For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. <sup>6</sup>But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said: <a id="mk14-anno-6-t" href="#mk14-anno-6" class="annotation">•</a> Let her alone, why do you molest her? she hath wrought a good work upon me. <sup>7</sup>For the poor you have always with you; and when you will, you may do them good; but <sup><a id="mk14-fn-a-t" href="#mk14-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> me you have not always. <sup>8</sup>That which she had, she hath done; she hath prevented to anoint my body to the burial. <sup>9</sup>Amen I say to you, wheresoever this Ghospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her.</p>

    <p><sup>10</sup>And * Judas Iscariot one of the Twelve went his way to the chief Priests, for to betray him to them. <sup>11</sup>Who hearing were glad; and they promised him that they would give him money. And he sought how he might betray him conveniently.</p>
    
    <p><sup>12</sup>And * the first day of the Azymes when they sacrificed the Pasche, the Disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the Pasche? <sup>13</sup>And he sendeth two of his Disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him; <sup>14</sup>and whithersoever he entereth, say to the Master of the house, that the Master saith, where is my refectory, where I may eat the Pasch with my Disciples? <sup>15</sup>And he will show you a great chamber, adorned; and there prepare for us. <sup>16</sup>And his Disciples went their ways, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the Pasche. <sup>17</sup>And * when even was come, he cometh with the Twelve. <sup>18</sup>And when they were sitting at the table and eating, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said: Amen I say to you, that one of you shall betray me, he that eateth with me. <sup>19</sup>But they began to be sad, and to say to him severally: Is it I? <sup>20</sup>Who said to them: One of the Twelve, he that dippeth with me his hand in the dish. <sup>21</sup>and the Son of man indeed goeth, * as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were good for him, if that man had not been born. <sup>22</sup>And * while they were eating, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> took <a id="mk14-anno-22-t" href="#mk14-anno-22" class="annotation">•</a> bread: and blessing broke, and gave to them, and said: Take, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">This is <a id="mk14-anno-24-t" href="#mk14-anno-24" class="annotation">•</a> my body</span>. <sup>23</sup>And taking the <a id="mk14-anno-23-t" href="#mk14-anno-23" class="annotation">•</a> chalice, giving thanks he gave to them. And they <sup><a id="mk14-fn-b-t" href="#mk14-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> all drank of it. <sup>24</sup>And he said to them: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">This is <a id="mk14-anno-24-t" href="#mk14-anno-24" class="annotation">•</a> my blood of the new Testament, that shall be shed for many.</span> <sup>25</sup>Amen I say to you, that now I will not drink of the fruit <sup><a id="mk14-fn-c-t" href="#mk14-fn-c" class=afn>[c]</a></sup> of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the Kingdom of God. <sup>26</sup>And a hymn being said, they went forth into Mount-olivet.</p>
		
	<p><sup>27</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to them: You shall all be scandalised in me in this night: for it is written, <em>I will strike the Pastor, and the sheep shall be dispersed</em>. <sup>28</sup>But after that I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. <sup>29</sup>And Peter said to him: Although all shall be scandalised: yet not I. <sup>30</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to him: Amen I say to thee, that thou this day in this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt thrice deny me. <sup>31</sup>But he spoke more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.</p>
		
	<p><sup>32</sup>And they come into a farm-place called Gethsemani. And he saith to his Disciples: Sit you here, until I pray. <sup>33</sup>And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy. <sup>34</sup>And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay here, and watch. <sup>35</sup>And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat upon the ground; and he prayed that if it might be, the hour might pass from him; <sup>36</sup>and he said: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee, transfer this chalice from me, but not that which I will, but that which thou. <sup>37</sup>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Could thou not watch one hour? <sup>38</sup>Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into tentation. The spirit indeed is prompt, but the flesh infirm. <sup>39</sup>And going away again, he prayed, saying the self-same word. <sup>40</sup>And returning, again he found them asleep (for their eyes were heavy) and they wist not what they should answer him. <sup>41</sup>And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take rest. It sufficeth: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup>42</sup>Arise, let us go. Behold, he that shall betray me, is at hand.</p>
		
	<p><sup>43</sup>And * as he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot one of the Twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief Priests and the Scribes and the Ancients. <sup>44</sup>And the betrayer of him had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, it is he, lay hold on him, and lead him warily. <sup>45</sup>And when he was come, immediately going to him, he saith: Rabbi, and he kissed him. <sup>46</sup>But they laid hands upon him, and held him. <sup>47</sup>And one certain man of the standers-about drawing out a sword, smote the servant of the chief Priest, and cut off his ear. <sup>48</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering, said to them: As to a thief are you come out with swords and clubs to apprehend me? <sup>49</sup>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But, that the Scriptures may be fulfilled. <sup>50</sup>Then his Disciples leaving him, all fled. <sup>51</sup>And a certain young man followed him clothed with sindon upon the bare; and they took him. <sup>52</sup>But he casting off the sindon, fled from them naked.</p>

	<p><sup>53</sup>And they brought <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> to the chief Priest; and all the Priests and the Scribes and the Ancients assembled together. <sup>54</sup>And Peter followed him afar off even in unto the court of the high Priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself. <sup>55</sup>And the chief Priests and all the Council sought testimony against <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, that they might put him to death, neither found they. <sup>56</sup>For many spoke false witness against him; and the testimonies were not convenient. <sup>57</sup>And certain rising up, bare false witness against him, saying: <sup>58</sup>That we heard him say, * I will dissolve this temple made with hand, and in three days will I build another not made with hand. <sup>59</sup>And their testimony was not convenient. <sup>60</sup>And the high Priest rising up into the midst, asked <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, saying: Answerest thou nothing to these things that are objected to thee of these? <sup>61</sup>But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high Priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou Christ the Son of the Blessed God? <sup>62</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> saith to him: I am. And you shall see the * Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of Heaven. <sup>63</sup>And the high Priest renting his garments, saith: What need we witnesses any further? <sup>64</sup>You have heard blasphemy. How think you? Who all <sup><a id="mk14-fn-d-t" href="#mk14-fn-d" class=afn>[d]</a></sup> condemned him to be guilty of death. <sup>65</sup>And certain began to spit upon him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with buffets, and to say unto him: Prophecy; and the servants gave him blows.</p>

	<p><sup>66</sup>And when Peter was in the court beneath, there cometh one of the <sup><a id="mk14-fn-e-t" href="#mk14-fn-e" class=afn>[e]</a></sup> woman-servants of the high Priest. <sup>67</sup>And when she had seen Peter warming himself, beholding him she saith: And thou were with <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> of Nazareth. <sup>68</sup>But he denied, saying: Neither know I, neither wot I what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew. <sup>69</sup>And again a wench seeing him, began to say to the standers about: That this fellow is of them. <sup>70</sup>But he denied again. And after a while again they that stood by, said to Peter: Verily thou art of them; for thou art also a Galilaean. <sup>71</sup>But he <a id="mk14-anno-71-t" href="#mk14-anno-71" class="annotation">•</a> began to curse and to swear: That I know not this man whom you speak of. <sup>72</sup>And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep.</p>

	<p><a id="mk14-anno-4" href="#mk14-anno-4-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 4. <em>This waste</em>.) Religious offices done to Christ for signification, devotion, or honour sake, both then in his life, and now in the Holy Sacrament, be of some (under pretence of better bestowing such things upon the poor) condemned unjustly.</p>

	<p><a id="mk14-anno-6" href="#mk14-anno-6-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 6. <em>Let her alone</em>.) Christ answereth for the devout woman, and for defence of her fact, as we must answer against the ignorant and ill men, when they blame good men for giving their goods to the Church.</p>

	<p><a id="mk14-anno-22" href="#mk14-anno-22-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 22. <em>Bread</em>.) <em>This is bread before the Sacramental words, but the Consecration once done, of bread is made the flesh of Christ.</em> Ambros. lib. 4 ch. 4 de Sacramentis.</p> 

	<p><a id="mk14-anno-23" href="#mk14-anno-23-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 23. <em>Chalice</em>.) Wine and water is put into the Chalice, but is made blood by Consecration of the heavenly Word: though to avoid the loathsomeness which would be in the sight of blood, thou receivest that which hath the likeness and resemblance thereof. <em>Ambr. ibidem.</em></p>

	<p><a id="mk14-anno-24" href="#mk14-anno-24-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 22. <em>My body</em> 24. <em>My blood</em>.) Whosoever believeth it not to be true that is said, he falleth from grace and salvation</em>. Epiph. in Ancorato. <em>Let us ever give credit to God, and never resist him, though the thing that he saith seem never so absurd in our imagination, or far pass all our sense and understanding. For his words can not beguile us, but our sense may easily be deceived. Seeing therefore that he said: This is my body, let us never doubt of the matter</em>. Chrysost hom. 83. in Mat. sub finem.</p>

	<p><a id="mk14-anno-71" href="#mk14-anno-71-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 71. <em>He began to curse</em>.) In this one Apostle Peter, the first and chief in the order of Apostles, in whom the Church was figured, both sorts were to be signified, to wit, the strong and the weak, because without both the Church is not. <em>Aug. ser. 13 de verb. Do.</em> Again, Our Saviour would show by the example of the chief Apostle, that no man ought to presume of himself, when neither St. Peter could avoid the danger of mutability. <em>Aug. tract. 66 in Evang. Joa. Leo Ser. 9. de Pass. Do.</em></p>
