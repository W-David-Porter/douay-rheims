	<p><em>The chief of the Jews accuse him to Pilate the Gentile. (6) And (he seeking to deliver him) they persuade the common People (who hitherto were always ready to defend him) not only to prefer the murderer Barabbas, but also to cry</em> Crucifige <em>(to the reprobation of the whole Nation). (16) After many illusions, (20) he is crucified by the Gentiles. (29) Which the Jews seeing, do triumph as if they had now the victory. (33) But even then by many wonderful works he declareth his might, (42) and finally is buried honourably.</em></p>

	<p>AND forthwith in the morning the chief Priests with the Ancients and the Scribes and the whole Council, consulting together, binding <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> led and delivered him to Pilate. <sup>2</sup>And Pilate asked him: Art thou the King of the Jews? but he answering, said to him: Thou sayest. <sup>3</sup>And the chief Priests accused him in many things. <sup>4</sup>And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? see in how great things they accuse thee. <sup>5</sup>But <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answered nothing more; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>

    <p><sup>6</sup>And upon the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners whomsoever they had demanded. <sup>7</sup>And there was one called Barabbas, which was put in prison with seditious persons, who in a sedition had committed murder. <sup>8</sup>And when the multitude was come up, they began to require, according as always he did unto them. <sup>9</sup>And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the King of the Jews? <sup>10</sup>For he knew that the chief Priests for envy had delivered him. <sup>11</sup>But the <a id="mk15-anno-11-t" href="#mk15-anno-11" class="annotation">•</a> chief Priests moved the People, that he should release Barabbas rather to them. <sup>12</sup>And Pilate again answering, said to them: What will you then that I do to the King of the Jews? <sup>13</sup>But they again cried: Crucify him. <sup>14</sup>And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried the more: Crucify him. <sup>15</sup>And Pilate willing <a id="mk15-anno-15-t" href="#mk15-anno-15" class="annotation">•</a> to satisfy the People, released to them Barabbas, and delivered <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, having whipped him, for to be crucified.</p>

	<p><sup>16</sup>And * the soldiers led him into the court of the Palace, and they call together the whole band: <sup>17</sup>and they clothe him in purple, and plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. <sup>18</sup>And they began to salute him: Hail King of the Jews. <sup>19</sup>And they smote his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing the knees, they adored him. <sup>20</sup>And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple, and put on him his own garments, and they lead him forth to crucify him. <sup>21</sup>And they forced a certain man that passed by, Simon a Cyrenean coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to take up his cross. <sup>22</sup>And they bring him into the place Golgotha, which being interpreted is, <em>The place of Calvary</em>. <sup>23</sup>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; and he took it not.</p>
		
	<p><sup>24</sup>And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, who should take which. <sup>25</sup>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. <sup>26</sup>And the title of his cause was superscribed, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">King of the jews</span>. <sup>27</sup>And with him they crucify two thieves; one on the right hand, and another on his left. <sup>28</sup>And the Scripture was fulfilled that saith: <em>And with the wicked he was reputed</em>. <sup>29</sup>And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, ‘he that destroyeth’ the temple, and in three days ‘buildeth’ it: <sup>30</sup> <sup><a id="mk15-fn-a-t" href="#mk15-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> save thyself, coming down from the cross. <sup>31</sup>In like manner also the chief Priests mocking said with the Scribes one to another: He saved others, himself he can not save. <sup>32</sup>Let Christ the King of Israel come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, railed at him.</p>
		
	<p><sup>33</sup>And when it was the sixth hour, there was made darkness upon the whole earth until the ninth hour. <sup>34</sup>And at the ninth hour <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> cried out with a mighty voice, saying, <em>Eloi, Eloi, lamma-sabacthani?</em> Which is being interpreted, <em>My God, my God, why hast thou</em> <sup><a id="mk15-fn-b-t" href="#mk15-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> <em>forsaken me?</em> <sup>35</sup>And certain of the standers-about hearing, said: Behold, he calleth Elias. <sup>36</sup>And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it about a reed, gave him drink, saying: Let be, let us see if Elias come to take him down. <sup>37</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> putting forth a mighty voice, gave up the ghost. <sup>38</sup>And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. <sup>39</sup>And the Centurion that stood over against him, seeing that so crying he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the Son of God.</p>
		
	<p><sup>40</sup>And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and

	of Joseph, and Salome; <sup>41</sup>and when he was in Galilee, they followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up together with him to Hierusalem. <sup>42</sup>And when evening was now come (because it was the Parasceve, which is the Sabboth-eve) <sup>43</sup>came Joseph of Arimathaea a noble Senator, who himself also was expecting the Kingdom of God; and he went in boldly to Pilate, and asked the body of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>. <sup>44</sup>But Pilate marvelled if he were now dead. And sending for the Centurion, asked him if he were now dead. <sup>45</sup>And when he understood by the Centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. <sup>46</sup>And Joseph <a id="mk15-anno-46-t" href="#mk15-anno-46" class="annotation">•</a> buying sindon, and taking him down, wrapped him in the sindon, and laid him in a monument, that was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the monument. <sup>47</sup>And Mary Magdalene and Mary of Joseph beheld where he was laid.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. XV.</h4>
	<p><a id="mk15-anno-11" href="#mk15-anno-11-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 11. <em>Chief Priests</em>.) Heretics abuse the ignorant People with these naughty Priests of the old Testament, to make that name odious, and to discredit the Priests of Christ in the new Testament. But for these Priests, thou mayest not marvel that they are so busy against Christ, * partly because they were such as were intruded by the secular power of the Roman Emperor, and from year to year by bribery and friendship, not by succession according to the Law of Moyses; partly because the time was now come when the old Priesthood of Aaron should cease, and the new begin according to the order of Melchisedech: and for these causes God suffered their former privileges of wisdom and judgement and discretion to decay in these later usurpers, and that according to the prophet saying: <em>The Law shall perish from the Priest and counsel from the Ancients</em>. But the Priesthod of the new Testament is to continue unto the end of the world, and hath (as being the principal part of the Church) the assistance of the Holy Ghost forever promised, to teach it all truth; and for Peter the chief Priest thereof under Christ, our Saviour prayed, That his faith should not fail: and to the rest also he said: <em>He that heareth you, heareth me.</em></p>

	<p><a id="mk15-anno-2" href="#mk15-anno-15-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 15. <em>To satisfy the People</em>.) Pilate should have suffered death, rather than by other men’s provocation or commandment have executed an innocent: as a Christian judge should rather suffer all extremity, than give sentence of death against a Catholic man for his faith.</p>

	<p><a id="mk15-anno-46" href="#mk15-anno-46-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 46. <em>Buying sindon</em>.) This duty done to Christ’s body after his departure, was exceeding meritorious, and is therefore by holy writ so often commended for an example to faithful men, to use all honour and devotion towards the bodies of Saints and holy Persons.</p>
