	<p><em>The third day, to three women at his Sepulchre, an Angel telleth that he is risen, and will (as he promised Mar. 14, 28.) show himself in Galilee. (9) The same day he appeareth to Mary Magdalene, afterward to two Disciples: yet the Eleven will not believe it, until to them also he appeareth. (15) To whom having given commission into all Nations, with power also of Miracles, he ascendeth, and they plant his Church everywhere.</em></p>

    <p>AND when the Sabboth was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary of James, and Salome <a id="mk16-anno-1-t" href="#mk16-anno-1" class="annotation">•</a> bought spices, that coming they might anoint <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>. <sup>2</sup>And very early the first of the Sabboths, they come to the monument, the sun being now risen. <sup>3</sup>And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the monument? <sup>4</sup>And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great. <sup>5</sup>And entering into the monument, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand covered with a white robe; and they were astonished. <sup>6</sup>Who saith to them: Be not dismayed; you seek <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> of Nazareth, that was crucified; he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him. <sup>7</sup>But go, tell his Disciples and <sup><a id="mk16-fn-a-t" href="#mk16-fn-a" class=afn>[a]</a></sup> Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, * as he told you. <sup>8</sup>But they going forth, fled from the monument. For trembling and fear had invaded them: and they said nothing to anybody, for they were afraid.</p>
    
    <p><sup>9</sup>And he rising early the first of the Sabboth, * appeared first to Mary Magdalen, * out of whom he had cast seven Devils. <sup>10</sup>She went and told them that had been with him, that were mourning and weeping. <sup>11</sup>And they hearing that he was alive and had been seen of her, did not believe.</p>
    
    <p><sup>12</sup>And * after this he appeared <a id="mk16-anno-12-t" href="#mk16-anno-12" class="annotation">•</a> in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country. <sup>13</sup>And they going told the rest: neither them did they believe.</p>
    
    <p><sup>14</sup>Last * he appeared to those Eleven as they sat at the table; and he exprobrated their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them that had seen him risen again. <sup>15</sup>And he said to them: * Going into the whole world preach the Ghospel to all creatures. <sup>16</sup>He that <a id="mk16-anno-16-t" href="#mk16-anno-16" class="annotation">•</a> believeth and is baptised, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be condemned. <sup>17</sup>And them that believe <a id="mk16-anno-17-t" href="#mk16-anno-17" class="annotation">•</a> these signs shall follow: In my name shall they cast out Devils; They shall speak with new tongues; <sup>18</sup>Serpents shall they take away; And if they drink any deadly things, it shall not hurt them; They shall <sup><a id="mk16-fn-b-t" href="#mk16-fn-b" class=afn>[b]</a></sup> impose hands upon the sick and they shall be whole.</p>
    
    <p><sup>19</sup>And so our Lord <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> after he spoke unto them, * was assumpted into Heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. <sup>20</sup>But they going forth preached everywhere: our Lord working withal, and confirming the Word with signs that followed. </p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. XVI.</h4>
	<p><a id="mk16-anno-1" href="#mk16-anno-1-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 1. <em>Bought spices</em>.) As she did bestow and consume a costly ointment upon his body being yet alive (c. 14, 3.) Christ himself defending and highly commending the fact against Judas and other who accounted it to be superfluous and better to be bestowed otherwise: So not without great devotion and merit, she and these other women seek to anoint his body dead (though Heretics or other simple persons may pretend such things to be better bestowed upon the poor) and therefore, * she first before all other, * and they next, saw him after his Resurrection.</p>
    
    <p><a id="mk16-anno-12" href="#mk16-anno-12-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 12. <em>In another shape</em>.) Christ though he have but one corporal shape, natural to his Person, yet by his omnipotence he may be in whatsoever form, and appear in the likeness of any other man or creature, as he list. Therefore let no man think it strange, that he may be under the form of bread in the Bl. Sacrament.</p>
    
    <p><a id="mk16-anno-16" href="#mk16-anno-16-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 16. <em>He that believeth</em>.) Note well, that whereas this Evangelist mentioneth only faith and Baptism, as though to believe and to be baptized were enough, St. Matthew addeth these words also of our Saviour, <em>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you</em>, which containeth all good works and the whole justice of a Christian man.</p>
    
	<p><a id="mk16-anno-17" href="#mk16-anno-17-t" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 17. <em>These signs shall follow</em>.) It is not meant, that all Christians or true believers should do miracles; but that some for the proof of the faith of all, should have that gift. The which is the grace or gift of the whole Church, executed by certain for the edification and profit of the whole.</p>
