	<p>The second, of the preparation that was made to his manifestation: chap. 3 and a piece of the 4th.</p>
	<p>The third, of his manifesting of himself by preaching and miracles, and that in Galilee: the other piece of the 4th chap. unto the 19th.</p>
	<p>The fourth, of his coming into Jewry, toward of his Passion: chap. 19 and 20.</p>
	<p>The fifth, of the Holy week of his Passion in Jerusalem: chap. 21 unto the end of the book.</p>

	<p>Of St. Matthew we have Mat. 9, Mar. 2, Luc. 5. How being before a Publican, he was called of our Lord, and made a Disciple. Then Luc. 6, Mar. 3, Mat. 10, how out of the whole number of the Disciples he was chosen to be one of the twelve Apostles. And out of them again he was chosen (and none but he and St. John) to be one of the four Evangelists. Among which four also, he was the first that wrote, about 8 or 10 years after Christ’s Ascension.</p>
