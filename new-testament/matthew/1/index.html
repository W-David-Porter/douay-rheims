    <p><em>The pedigree of Jesus, to show that he is Christ, promised to Abraham and David. (18) That he was conceived and born of a Virgin, as Esay prophesied of him.</em></p>

  <div class=verse>
    <p>T<span style="font-variant:small-caps">He</span> book of the generation of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p>
    
    <p><sup>2</sup>Abraham begat Isaac, And Isaac begat Jacob. And Jacob begat Judas and his brethren: <sup>3</sup>And Judas begat Phares and Zaram of <a id="mt1-anno-3" href="#mt1-anno-3t" class="annotation">&bull;</a> Thamar. And Phares begat Esron. And Esron begat Aram. <sup>4</sup>And Aram begat Aminadab. And Aminadab begat Naasson. And Naasson begat Salmon. <sup>5</sup>And Salmon begat Booz of Raab. And Booz begat Obed of Ruth. And Obed begat Jess. <sup>6</sup>And Jess begat David the King.</p>
  
    <p>And David the King begat Salomon of her that was the wife of Vrias. <sup>7</sup>And Salomon begat Roboam. And Roboam begat Abia. And Abia begat Asa. <sup>8</sup>And Asa begat Josaphat. And Josaphat begat Joram. And Joram begat Ozias. <sup>9</sup>And Ozias begat Joatham. And Joatham begat Achaz. And Achaz begat Ezechias. <sup>10</sup>And Ezechias begat Manasses. And Manasses begat Amon. And Amon begat Josias. <sup>11</sup>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren in the Transmigration of Babylon.</p>
  
    <p><sup>12</sup>And after the Transmigration of Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel. And Salathiel begat Zorobabel. <sup>13</sup>And Zorobabel begat Abiud. And Abiud begat Eliacim. And Eliacim begat Azor. <sup>14</sup>And Azor begat Sadoc. And Sadoc begat Achim. And Achim begat Eliud. <sup>15</sup>And Eliud begat Eleazar. And Eleazar begat Mathan. And Mathan begat Jacob. <sup>16</sup>And Jacob begat <a id="mt1-anno-16t" href="#mt1-anno-16" class="annotation">&bull;</a> Joseph the husband of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mary</span>: of whom was born <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, who is called <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>.</p>
  
    <p><sup>17</sup>Therefore all the Generations from Abraham unto David, fourteen Generations. And from David to the Transmigration of Babylon, fourteen Generations. And from the Transmigration of Babylon unto <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span>, fourteen Generations.</p>
  
    <p><sup>18</sup>And the Generation of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Christ</span> was in this wise. When his mother <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mary</span> was spoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child, by the Holy Ghost. <sup>19</sup>Whereupon Joseph her husband for that he was a <sup><a id="mt1-fn-a-t" href="#mt1-fn-a" class=afn>[<em>a</em>]</a></sup> just man, and would not put her to open shame: was minded secretly to dismiss her. <sup>20</sup>But as he was thus thinking, behold the Angel of our Lord appeared to him in sleep saying: Joseph son of David, fear not to take <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mary</span> thy wife, for that which is <a id="mt1-anno-20t" href="#mt1-anno-20" class="annotation">&bull;</a> born in her, is of the Holy Ghost. <sup>21</sup>And she shall bring forth a Son: and thou shalt call his name <sup><a id="mt1-fn-b-t" href="#mt1-fn-b" class=afn>[<em>b</em>]</a></sup> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>. For he shall save his people from their sins.  <sup>22</sup>And all this was done that it might be fulfilled which our Lord spoke by the Prophet saying: <sup>23</sup><em>Behold <a id="mt1-anno-23at" href="#mt1-anno-23a" class="annotation">&bull;</a> a Virgin shall be with child, and <a id="mt1-anno-23bt" href="#mt1-anno-23b" class="annotation">&bull;</a> bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel</em>, which being interpreted is, <em>God with us</em>. <sup>24</sup>And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the Angel of our Lord commanded him, and took his wife. And he knew her not <a id="mt1-anno-24at" href="#mt1-anno-24a" class="annotation">&bull;</a> till she brought forth her <a id="mt1-anno-24bt" href="#mt1-anno-24b" class="annotation">&bull;</a> first born Son: and called his name <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>.</p>

    <h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. I.</h4>
    <p><a id="mt1-anno-3t" href="#mt1-anno-3" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 3. <em>Thamar</em>.) Christ abhorred not to take flesh of some that were ill, as he chose Judas among his Apostles: Let not us disdain to receive our spiritual birth and sustenance of such as be not always good.</p>
  
    <p><a id="mt1-anno-16t" href="#mt1-anno-16" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 16. <em>Joseph</em>.) Joseph marrying our Lady as near of kin (for so was the law) by his pedigree showeth hers, and consequently Christ&rsquo;s pedigree from David.</p>
  
    <p><a href="#mt1-anno-16" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 16. <em>Husband</em>.) True and perfect marriage, and continual living in the same, without carnal copulation, <em>Aug. lib. 2 Consen. Evang. ch. 1.</em>
  
    <p><a id="mt1-anno-20t" href="#mt1-anno-20" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 20. <em>Born in her</em>.) The triple good or perfection of marriage accomplished in the parents of Christ, to wit, Issue, Fidelity, Sacrament, <em>Aug. de nup. and conc. lib. 1 ch. 11</em>.</p>
  
    <p><a id="mt1-anno-23at" href="#mt1-anno-23a" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 23. <em>A virgin</em>.) Our Saviour born in marriage, but yet of a Virgin, would honour both states: and withal, teacheth us against Jovinian the old Heretik and these of our time, that virginity and the continent life are preferred before marriage that hath carnal copulation, <em>See St. Jerom. adv. Jovin. and St. Greg. Nazianz. Ser. 20 de studio in pauperes, in initio.</em></p>
  
    <p><a id="mt1-anno-23bt" href="#mt1-anno-23b" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 23. <em>A virgin</em>.) As our Lady both a virgin and a mother, brought forth Christ the head corporally: so the Church a virgin and a mother, bringeth forth the members of this head spiritually, <em>Aug. lib. de Virg. ca. 2</em>.</p>
  
    <p><a id="mt1-anno-24at" href="#mt1-anno-24a" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 24. <em>And bring forth</em>.) The Heretic Jovinian is here refuted, holding that her virginity was corrupted in bringing forth Christ, <em>Aug. haer. 28 Lib. 1 cont. Julian. ch. 2</em>.</p>
  
    <p><a id="mt1-anno-24bt" href="#mt1-anno-24b" class=anno-fn-return>↑</a> 24. <em>Till, First-born</em>.) Helvidius of old abused these words, <em>till</em>, and <em>first born</em>, against the perpetual virginity of our Bl. Lady, <em>Jero. cont. Helv.</em>, which truth though not expressed in Scripture, yet our Adversaries also do grant, and Helvidius for denial thereof was condemned for a heretic by tradition only, <em>Aug. haer. 84</em>.</p>
