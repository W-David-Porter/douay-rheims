	<p><em>He riseth again the third day, and (the blind most obstinate Jews by bribery working to their own reprobation) he appeareth to his Disciples in Galilee (as both before his Passion he foretold them, Mat. 26, and now after his Resurrection, first the Angel, then also himself appointed by the women) (18)&nbsp;and sendeth them to all Nations, to build his Church among the Gentiles.</em></p>

<div class=verse>
	<p>AND in the evening of the Sabboth which dawneth on the first of the Sabboth, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary <a id="mt28-anno-1-t" href="#mt28-anno-1" class="annotation">&bull;</a> to see the sepulchre. <sup>2</sup>And behold there was made a great earth-quake. For an Angel of our Lord descended from Heaven: and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it: <sup>3</sup>and his countenance was as lightning, and his garment as snow. <sup>4</sup>And for fear of him, the watchmen were frighted, and became as dead. <sup>5</sup>And the Angel answering said to the women: Fear not you. For I know that you seek <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> that was crucified. <sup>6</sup>He is not here, for he is risen, * as he said. Come, and see the place where our Lord was laid. <sup>7</sup>And going quickly tell ye his Disciples that he is risen: and behold he goeth before you into Galilee: there you shall see him. Lo I have foretold you.</p>

	<p><sup>8</sup>And they went forth quickly out of the monument with fear and great joy, running to tell his Disciples. <sup>9</sup>And behold <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> met them, saying: All hail. But they came near and took hold of his feet, and adored him. <sup>10</sup>Then <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, there they shall see me.</p>

	<p><sup>11</sup>Who when they were departed, behold certain of the watchmen came into the city, and told the chief Priests all things that had been done. <sup>12</sup>And being assembled together with the Ancients, taking counsel, they gave a great sum of money to the soldiers, <sup>13</sup>saying: Say you, that his Disciples came by night, and stole him away when we were asleep. <sup>14</sup>And if the President shall hear of this, we will persuade him, and make you secure. <sup>15</sup>But they taking the money, did as they were taught. And this word was bruited abroad among the Jews, even unto this day.</p>

	<p><sup>16</sup>And the eleven Disciples went into Galilee, unto the mount where <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> had appointed them. <sup>17</sup>And seeing him they adored, but some doubted. <sup>18</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> coming near spoke unto them, saying: All power is given to me in Heaven and in earth. <sup>19</sup> <a id="mt28-anno-19-t" href="#mt28-anno-19" class="annotation">&bull;</a> going therefore teach ye all nations: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Baptizing them in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the Holy Ghost</span>, <sup>20</sup>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you <a id="mt28-anno-20-t" href="#mt28-anno-20" class="annotation">&bull;</a> all days, even to the consummation of the world.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. XXVIII.</h4>
	<p><a id="mt28-anno-1" href="#mt28-anno-1-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 1. <em>To see the Sepulchre</em>.) The devout women came to visit our Saviour’s sepulchre, and for their devotion first deserved to know the Resurrection, and to see him risen. The honour of the which Sepulchre, and the Pilgrimage thereunto in the Primitive Church, St. Jerom declareth in these words, <em>The Jews sometime honoured Sancta Sanctorum, because there were the Cherubs and the Propitiatory, and the Ark of the Testament, Manna, Aaron’s rod, and the golden Altar. Doth not the Sepulchre of our Lord seem unto thee more honourable? Which as often as we enter into so often do we see our Saviour lie in the sindon and staying there a while, we see the Angel again sit at his feet, and at his head the napkin wrapped together. The glory of whose Sepulchre, we know was long prophesied before Joseph hewed it out, by Esay saying: And his rest shall be honour: to wit, because the place of our Lord’s burial should be honoured of all men</em>. And at this present, notwithstanding the Turk’s dominion, yet do the Religious Christian Catholic men by God’s mighty providence keep the holy Sepulchre, which is within a goodly Church, and Christians come out of all the world in Pilgrimage to it.</p>

	<p><a id="mt28-anno-19" href="#mt28-anno-19-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 19. <em>Going therefore</em>.) Commission to baptize and preach to all Nations given to the Apostles, and grounded upon Christ’s sovereign authority, to whom was given all power in Heaven and in earth.</p>

	<p><a id="mt28-anno-20" href="#mt28-anno-20-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 20. <em>With you all days</em>.) Here Christ does promise his concurrence with his Apostles and their Successors, as well in preaching as ministering the Sacraments, and his protection of the Church never to cease till the world’s end: contrary to our Adversaries, saying that the Church hath failed many hundred years till Luther and Calvin.</p>
