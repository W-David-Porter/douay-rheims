	<p><em>Continuing his Sermon, he bringeth two parables, of ten Virgins, and of Talants, to show how it shall be in Doomsday with the Faithful that prepare, and that prepare not themselves. (31)&nbsp;then also without parables he showeth that such Faithful as do works of mercy, shall have for them life everlasting: and such as do not, everlasting damnation.</em></p>

	<p>THEN shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like to ten <a id="mt25-anno-1a-t" href="#mt25-anno-1a" class="annotation">&bull;</a> Virgins, which taking their <a id="mt25-anno-1b-t" href="#mt25-anno-1b" class="annotation">&bull;</a> lamps went forth to meet the Bridegroom and the Bride. <sup>2</sup>And five of them were foolish, and five wise. <sup>3</sup>But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take <a id="mt25-anno-3-t" href="#mt25-anno-3" class="annotation">&bull;</a> oil with them: <sup>4</sup>but the wise did take oil in their vessels with the lamps. <sup>5</sup>And the Bridegroom tarrying long they slumbered all and slept. <sup>6</sup>And at midnight there was a clamour made: Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him. <sup>7</sup>Then arose all those Virgins, and they trimmed their lamps. <sup>8</sup>And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of <sup><a id="mt25-fn-a-t" href="#mt25-fn-a" class=afn>[<em>a</em>]</a></sup> your oil, because our lamps are going out. <sup>9</sup>The wise answered, saying: Lest peradventure there suffice not for us and you, go rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. <sup>10</sup>And while they went to buy, the Bridegroom was come: and they that were ready, entered with him to the marriage, and the gate was shut. <sup>11</sup>But last of all come also the other Virgins saying: Lord, Lord, open to us. <sup>12</sup>But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not. <sup>13</sup>Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.</p>

	<p><sup>14</sup>For * even as a man going into a strange country, called his servants, and delivered them his goods. <sup>15</sup>And to one he gave five talants, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper faculty: and immediately he took his journey. <sup>16</sup>And he that had received the five talants, went his way, and occupied with the same, and gained other five. <sup>17</sup>Likewise also he that had received the two, gained other two. <sup>18</sup>But he that had received the one, going his way dug into the earth, and hid his Lord’s money. <sup>19</sup>But after much time the Lord of those servants cometh, and made account with them. <sup>20</sup>And there came he that had received the five talants, and offered other five talants, saying: Lord five talants thou didst deliver me, behold <sup><a id="mt25-fn-b-t" href="#mt25-fn-b" class=afn>[<em>b</em>]</a></sup> I have gained other five besides. <sup>21</sup>His lord said unto him: Well-fare thee good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things I will place thee over many things: enter into the joy of thy Lord. <sup>22</sup>And there came also he that had received the two talants, and said: Lord two talants thou didst deliver me: behold I have gained other two. <sup>23</sup>His lord said to him: Well-fare thee good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things, enter into the joy of thy Lord. <sup>24</sup>And he also that had received the one talant, came forth, and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou didst not sow: and gatherest where thou strawed not: <sup>25</sup>and being afraid I went, and hid thy talant in the earth: behold here thou hast that which thine is. <sup>26</sup>And his Lord answering, said to him: <sup><a id="mt25-fn-c-t" href="#mt25-fn-c" class=afn>[<em>c</em>]</a></sup> Naughty and slothful servant, thou didst know that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I strawed not: <sup>27</sup>thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and coming I might have received my own <a id="mt25-anno-27-t" href="#mt25-anno-27" class="annotation">•</a> with usury. <sup>28</sup>Take ye away therefore the talant from him, and give it him that hath ten talants. <sup>29</sup>For to * everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which <a id="mt25-anno-29-t" href="#mt25-anno-29" class="annotation">•</a> he seemeth to have, shall be taken away from him. <sup>30</sup>And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the utter darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

	<p><sup>31</sup>And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the Angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty: <sup>32</sup>and all Nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall <a id="mt25-anno-32-t" href="#mt25-anno-32" class="annotation">•</a> separate them one from another, as the pastor separateth the sheep from the goats: <sup>33</sup>and shall set the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at his left. <sup>34</sup>Then shall the King say to them that shall be at his right hand: <a id="mt25-anno-34-t" href="#mt25-anno-34" class="annotation">&bull;</a> Come ye Blessed of my Father, possess you the Kingdom <sup><a id="mt25-fn-d-t" href="#mt25-fn-d" class=afn>[<em>d</em>]</a></sup> prepared for you from the foundation of the world <sup>35</sup>For I was a hungered, and <a id="mt25-anno-35-t" href="#mt25-anno-35" class="annotation">&bull;</a> you gave me to eat: I was athirst, and you gave me to drink. <sup>36</sup>I was a stranger, and you took me in: naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me. <sup>37</sup>Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee a hungered, and fed thee, a thirst, and gave thee drink? <sup>38</sup>and when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee? <sup>39</sup>or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee? <sup>40</sup>And the King answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me. <sup>41</sup>Then he shall say to them also that shall be at his left hand:  <a id="mt25-anno-41-t" href="#mt25-anno-41" class="annotation">•</a> Get ye away from me you cursed into fire everlasting, which was prepared for the Devil and his Angels. <sup>42</sup>For I was a hungered, and you <a id="mt25-anno-42-t" href="#mt25-anno-42" class="annotation">•</a> gave me not to eat; I was athirst, and you gave me not to drink. <sup>43</sup>I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me. <sup>44</sup>Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee a hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee? <sup>45</sup>Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these lesser, neither did you it to me. <sup>46</sup>And these shall go into punishment everlasting: but the just, into life everlasting.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. XXV.</h4>
	<p><a id="mt25-anno-1a" href="#mt25-anno-1a-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 1. <em>Virgins</em>.) These virgins five wise, and five foolish, signify that in the Church militant there be good and bad: which bad shall be shut out at the later day, although they have lamps (that is faith) as the other, because their lamps are out; that is, their faith is dead without charity and good works to lighten them, <em>Greg. hom. 12</em>.</p>

	<p><a id="mt25-anno-1b" href="#mt25-anno-1b-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 1. <em>Lamps</em>.) These lamps lighted, be good works, namely of mercy, and the laudable conversation which shineth before men, <em>Aug. ep. 120. ch. 33</em>.</p>

	<p><a id="mt25-anno-3" href="#mt25-anno-3-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 3. <em>Oil</em>.) This oil is the right inward intention directing our works to God’s glory, and not to the praise of ourselves in the sight of men, <em>Aug. ep. 120. ch. 33</em>.</p>

	<p><a id="mt25-anno-27" href="#mt25-anno-27-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 27. <em>With usury</em>.) Usury is here taken for the lawful gain that a man getteth by well employing his goods. When God gives us any talant or talants, he looketh for usury, that is, for spiritual increase of the same by our diligence and industry.</p>

	<p><a id="mt25-anno-29" href="#mt25-anno-29-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 29. <em>That which he seemeth to have</em>.) He is said to have God’s gifts, that useth them, and to such a one God will increase his gifts. He that useth them not, seemeth to have, rather than hath them, and from him God will withdraw that which before he gave.</p>

	<p><a id="mt25-anno-32" href="#mt25-anno-32-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 32. <em>Separate</em>.) Lo here is the separation; for in the Church militant they lived both together. As for Heretics, they went out of the Church before, and separated themselves, and therefore are not to be separated here, as being judged already.</p>

	<p><a id="mt25-anno-34" href="#mt25-anno-34-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 34. <em>Come ye</em>. <a id="mt25-anno-41" href="#mt25-anno-41-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 41. <em>Get ye away</em>.) It is no incongruity that God should say: Go into everlasting fire, to them that by their free will have repelled his mercy; and to the other: Come ye Blessed of my Father, take the Kingdom prepared for you, that by their free will have received faith, and confessed their sins, and done penance, <em>Aug. lib. 2 act. cum Fel. Manich. ch. 8</em>.</p>

	<p><a id="mt25-anno-35" href="#mt25-anno-35-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 35. <em>You gave me</em>.) Hereby we see how much alms-deeds and all works of mercy prevail towards life everlasting, and to blot out former sins, <em>Aug. in Ps. 49</em>.</p>

	<p><a id="mt25-anno-42" href="#mt25-anno-42-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 42. <em>Gave me not</em>.) He chargeth them not here that they believed not, but that they did not good works. For such did believe, but they cared not for good works, as though by dead faith they might have come to Heaven, <em>Aug. de fid. and op. ch. 15 and ad Dulcit. q. 2–4</em>.</p>
