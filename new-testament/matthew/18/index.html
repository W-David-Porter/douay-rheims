	<p><em>To his Disciples he preacheth against ambition the mother of Schism: (7)&nbsp;foretelling both the author whosoever he be, and also his followers, of their woe to come. (10)&nbsp;And showing on the contrary side, how precious Christian souls are to their Angels, to the Son of man, and to his Father. (15)&nbsp; Charging us therefore to forgive our brethren, when also we have just cause against them, be it never so often, and to labour their salvation by all means possible.</em></p>
</div>
<div class=verse>
	<p>AT that hour the Disciples came to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span>, saying: <a id="mt18-anno-1-t" href="#mt18-anno-1" class="annotation">&bull;</a> Who, thinkest thou, is the greater in the Kingdom of Heaven? <sup>2</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> calling unto him a little child, set him in the midst of them, <sup>3</sup>and said: Amen I say to you, unless you be converted, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. <sup>4</sup>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this <sup><a id="mt18-fn-a-t" href="#mt18-fn-a" class=afn>[<em>a</em>]</a></sup> little child, he is the greater in the Kingdom of Heaven. <sup>5</sup>And he that shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me. <sup>6</sup>And * he that shall scandalise one of these little ones that believe in me, it is expedient for him that a millstone be hanged about his neck, and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea.</p>

	<p><sup>7</sup>Woe be to the world for <a id="mt18-anno-7-t" href="#mt18-anno-7" class="annotation">&bull;</a> scandals. For it is necessary that scandals do come: but nevertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal cometh. <sup>8</sup>And * if thy <a id="mt18-anno-8-t" href="#mt18-anno-8" class="annotation">&bull;</a> hand, or thy foot scandalise thee: cut it off, and cast it from thee. It is good for thee to go into life maimed or lame, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire. <sup>9</sup>And if thine eye scandalise thee, pluck him out, and cast him from thee: It is good for thee having one eye to enter into life, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Hell of fire. <sup>10</sup>See that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, that <a id="mt18-anno-10-t" href="#mt18-anno-10" class="annotation">&bull;</a> their Angels in Heaven always do see the face of my Father which is in Heaven. <sup>11</sup>For * the Son of man is come to save that which was perished. <sup>12</sup> * How think you? If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them shall go astray; doth he not leave ninety-nine in the mountains, and goeth to seek that which is strayed? <sup>13</sup>And if it chance that he find it: Amen I say to you, that he rejoices more for that, then for the ninety-nine that went not astray. <sup>14</sup>Even so it is not the will of your Father, which is in Heaven, that one perish of these little ones.</p>

	<p><sup>15</sup>But * if thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother. <sup>16</sup>And if he will not hear you, join with thee besides, one or two: that in the mouth of * two or three witnesses every word may stand. <sup>17</sup>And if he will not hear them, <sup><a id="mt18-fn-b-t" href="#mt18-fn-b" class=afn>[<em>b</em>]</a></sup> tell the Church. <em>And if he will <a id="mt18-anno-17a-t" href="#mt18-anno-17a" class="annotation">&bull;</a> not hear the Church, let him be to thee as  the <a id="mt18-anno-17b-t" href="#mt18-anno-17b" class="annotation">&bull;</a> heathen and Publican</em>. <sup>18</sup>Amen I say to you, whatsoever you <a id="mt18-anno-18a-t" href="#mt18-anno-18a" class="annotation">&bull;</a> shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in Heaven: and whatsoever you <a id="mt18-anno-18b-t" href="#mt18-anno-18b" class="annotation">&bull;</a> shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in Heaven. <sup>19</sup>Again I say to you, that if two of you shall <sup><a id="mt18-fn-c-t" href="#mt18-fn-c" class=afn>[<em>c</em>]</a></sup> consent upon earth, concerning everything whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be done to them of my Father which is in Heaven. <sup>20</sup>For where there be two or three gathered in my name, there am I <a id="mt18-anno-20-t" href="#mt18-anno-20" class="annotation">&bull;</a> in the midst of them.</p>

	<p><sup>21</sup>Then came Peter unto him and said: * Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? <sup>22</sup><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> said to him: I say not to thee * until seven times but until <a id="mt18-anno-22-t" href="#mt18-anno-22" class="annotation">&bull;</a> seventy times seven times. ✠ <sup>23</sup>Therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened to a man being a King, that would make an account with his servants. <sup>24</sup>And when he began to make the account, there was one presented unto him that owed him ten thousand talants. <sup>25</sup>And having not whence to repay it, his Lord commanded that he should be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and it to be repaid. <sup>26</sup>But that servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience toward me, and I will repay thee all. <sup>27</sup>And the Lord of that servant moved with pity, dismissed him, and the debt he forgave him. <sup>28</sup>And when that servant was gone forth, he found one of his fellow-servants that did owe him a hundred pence: and laying hands upon him throttled him, saying: Repay that thou owest. <sup>29</sup>And his fellow servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience toward me, and I will repay thee all. <sup>30</sup>And he would not: but went his way, and cast him into prison, till he repaid the debt. <sup>31</sup>And his fellow-servants seeing what was done, were very sorry, and they came, and told their Lord all that was done. <sup>32</sup>Then his Lord called him; and he said unto him: Thou ungracious servant, I forgave thee all the debt because thou besoughtest me: oughtest not thou therefore also to have mercy upon thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy upon thee? <sup>33</sup>And his Lord being angry delivered him to the tormenters, until he repaid all the debt. <sup>34</sup>So also shall my Heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive not everyone his brother from your hearts. ✠</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. XVIII.</h4>
	<p><a id="mt18-anno-1" href="#mt18-anno-1-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 1. <em>Who is the greater</em>.) The occasion of this question, and of their contention for Superiority among the rest of their infirmities, which they had before the coming of the Holy Ghost, was (as certain holy Doctors write) upon emulation toward Peter, whom only they saw preferred before the rest, in the payment of the tribute, by these words of our Saviour: Give it them for me and thee. <em>Chrys. hom. 59 Jer. in Mat.</em> Upon this place.</p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-7" href="#mt18-anno-7-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 7. <em>Scandals</em>.) The simple be most annoyed by taking scandal of their Preachers’, Priests’, and elders’ ill life; and great damnation is to the guides of the People, whether they be temporal or spiritual, but specially to the spiritual, if by their ill example and scandalous life the People be scandalised.</p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-8" href="#mt18-anno-8-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 8. <em>Hand, foot, eye</em>.) By these parts of the body so necessary and profitable for a man, is signified, that whatsoever is nearest and dearest to us, wife, children, friends, riches, all are to be contemned and forsaken for to save our soul.</p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-10" href="#mt18-anno-10-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 10. <em>Their Angels</em>.) A great dignity and a marvellous benefit, that every one has from his Nativity an Angel for his custody and patronage, against the wicked, before the face of God. <em>Jer. upon this place.</em> And the thing is so plain, that Calvin dare not deny it, and yet he will needs doubt of it. <em>lib. 1 Inst. ch. 14 sect. 7.</em></p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-17a" href="#mt18-anno-17a-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 17. <em>Not hear the Church</em>.) Not only Heretics, but any other obstinate offender that will not be judged nor ruled by the Church, may be excommunicated, and so made as a Heathen or Publican was to the Jews, by the discipline of the same, casting him out of the fellowship of Catholics. Which Excommunication is a greater punishment, than if he were executed by sword, fire, and wild beasts. <em>Aug. cont. Adv. leg. lib. 1 ch. 17.</em> And again he saith: Man is more sharply and pitifully bound by the Church’s Keys, than with any iron or adamantine manacles or fetters, in the world. <em>Aug. ibidem.</em></p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-17b" href="#mt18-anno-17b-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 17. <em>Heathen</em>.) Heretics therefore because they will not hear the Church, be no better nor no otherwise to be esteemed of Catholics, than Heathen men and Publicans were esteemed among the Jews.</p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-18a" href="#mt18-anno-18a-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 18. <em>You shall bind</em>.) As before he gave this power of binding and loosing over the whole, first of all and principally to Peter, upon whom he builded his Church: so here not only to Peter, and in him to his successors, but also to the other Apostles, and in them to their successors, every one in their charge. <em>Jerom. lib. 1 ch. 14 advers. Jovin. and Epist. ad Heliod. Cyprian. de unit. Eccl. nu. 3.</em></p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-18b" href="#mt18-anno-18b-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 18. <em>Shall loose</em>.) Our Lord gives no less right and authority to the Church to loose, than to bind, as St. Ambrose writeth against the Novatians, who confessed that the Priests had power to bind, but not to loose.</p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-20" href="#mt18-anno-20-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 20. <em>In the midst of them</em>.) Not all assemblies may challenge the presence of Christ; but only such as be gathered together in the unity of the Church, and therefore no conventicles of Heretics directly gathering against the Church, are warranted by this place. <em>Cypr. de unit. Eccles. nu. 7, 8.</em></p>

	<p><a id="mt18-anno-22" href="#mt18-anno-22-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 22. <em>Seventy times seven</em>.) There must be no end of forgiving them that be penitent, either in the Sacrament by absolution, or one man another their offences.</p>
