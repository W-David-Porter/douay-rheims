	<p><em>To show how through God’s grace the Jews shall be overrun of the Gentiles, although they begin after, he bringeth a parable of men working sooner and later in the vineyard, but the later rewarded in the end even as the first. (17) He revealeth more to his Disciples touching his passion: (20) Bidding the ambitious two suitors to think rather of suffering with him: (24) And teaching us (in the rest of his Disciples) not to be grieved at our Ecclesiastical Superiors, considering they are (as he was himself) to toil for our Salvation. (29) Then going out of Jericho, he gives sight unto two blind.</em></p>

<div class=verse>
	<p>THE Kingdom of Heaven is like to a man that is a Householder which went forth early <a id="mt20-anno-1-t" href="#mt20-anno-1" class="annotation">&bull;</a> in the morning to hire workmen into his vineyard. <sup>2</sup>And having made covenant with the workmen for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. <sup>3</sup>And going forth about the third hour, he saw other standing in the market place idle, <sup>4</sup>and he said to them: Go you also into the vineyard: and that which shall be just, I will give you. <sup>5</sup>And they went their way. And again he went forth about the sixth and the ninth hour: and did likewise. <sup>6</sup>But about the eleventh hour he went forth and found other standing, and he saith to them: What stand you here all the day idle? <sup>7</sup>They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into the vineyard.</p>

	<p><sup>8</sup>And when evening was come, the Lord of the vineyard saith to his Bailiff: Call the workmen, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first. <sup>9</sup>Therefore when they were come that came about the eleventh hour, they received every one <a id="mt20-anno-9-t" href="#mt20-anno-9" class="annotation">&bull;</a> a penny. <sup>10</sup>But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every one a penny. <sup>11</sup>And receiving it they <sup><a id="mt20-fn-a-t" href="#mt20-fn-a" class=afn>[<em>a</em>]</a></sup> murmured against the Good-man of the house, <sup>12</sup>saying: These last have continued one hour: and thou hast made them equal to us that have born the burden of the day and the heats. <sup>13</sup>But he answering said to one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not covenant with me for a penny? <sup>14</sup>Take that is thine, and go: I will also give to this last even as to thee also. <sup>15</sup>Or, is it not lawful for me to do that I will? Is thine eye naught, because I am good? <sup>16</sup>So shall the last be first, and the first, last. For many be called, but <a id="mt20-anno-16-t" href="#mt20-anno-16" class="annotation">&bull;</a> few elect. ✠</p>

	<p><sup>17</sup> * And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve Disciples secretly, and said to them: <sup>18</sup>Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief Priests and to the Scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, <sup>19</sup>and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again. ✠</p>

	<p><sup>20</sup> * Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and desiring something of him. <sup>21</sup>Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, one at thy right hand, and one at thy left hand in thy Kingdom. <sup>22</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> answering, said: You know not what you desire. Can you drink of the cup that I shall drink of? They say to him: We can. <sup>23</sup>He saith to them: My cup indeed you shall drink of: but to sit at my right hand and left, is not mine to give to you, but <a id="mt20-anno-23-t" href="#mt20-anno-23" class="annotation">&bull;</a> to whom it is prepared of my Father. ✠</p>

	<p><sup>24</sup>And the ten hearing it, were displeased at the two brethren. <sup>25</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> called them unto him, and said: * You know that the Princes of the Gentiles <sup><a id="mt20-fn-b-t" href="#mt20-fn-b" class=afn>[<em>b</em>]</a></sup> overrule them: and they that are the greater, exercise power against them. <sup>26</sup>It shall not be so among you, but whosoever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister: <sup>27</sup>And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant. <sup>28</sup>Even as the <a id="mt20-anno-28-t" href="#mt20-anno-28" class="annotation">&bull;</a> Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many. ✠</p>

	<p><sup>29</sup>And * when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. <sup>30</sup>And behold two blind men sitting by the wayside, heard that <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> passed by, and they cried out saying: Lord, have mercy upon us, Son of David. <sup>31</sup>And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace. But they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy upon us, Son of David. <sup>32</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> stood, and called them, and said: What will ye that I do to you? <sup>33</sup>They say to him: Lord, that our eyes may be opened. <sup>34</sup>And <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Jesus</span> having compassion on them, <sup><a id="mt20-fn-c-t" href="#mt20-fn-c" class=afn>[<em>c</em>]</a></sup> touched their eyes. And immediately they saw, and followed him.</p>

	<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. XX.</h4>
	<p><a id="mt20-anno-1" href="#mt20-anno-1-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 1. <em>In the morning</em>.) God calleth some in the morning, that is, in the beginning of the world, as Abel, Enoch, Noe, and other the just and faithful of the first Age; at the third hour, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of their Age; at the sixth hour of the day, Moyses, Aaron, and the rest; at the ninth hour, the Prophets; at the eleventh, that is, at the later end of the world, the Christian Nations, <em>Aug. de verb. Domini ser. 59</em>. Briefly, this calling at diverse hours signifieth the calling of the Jews from time to time in the first Ages of the world, and of the Gentiles in the later Age thereof. It signifieth also that God calleth countries to the faith some sooner, some later; and particular men to be his servants, some younger, some elder, of diverse ages.</p>

	<p><a id="mt20-anno-9" href="#mt20-anno-9-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 9. <em>Penny</em>.) The penny promised to all, was life everlasting, which is common to all that shall be saved. But in the same life there be degrees of glory, as * betwixt star and star in the element, <em>Aug. lib. de virginis. ch. 26</em>.</p>

	<p><a id="mt20-anno-16" href="#mt20-anno-16-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 16. <em>Few elect</em>.) Those are elect which despised not their caller, but followed and believed him; for men believe not but of their own free will, <em>Aug. lib. 1 ad Simplic. q. 2</em>.</p>

	<p><a id="mt20-anno-23" href="#mt20-anno-23-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 23. <em>To whom it is prepared</em>.) The Kingdom of Heaven is prepared for them that are worthy of it and deserve it by their well doing; as in holy Scripture it is very often: That <em>God will repay every man according to his works</em>. And, <em>Come ye blessed, possess the Kingdom prepared for you</em>. Why? <em>Because I was hungry, and you gave me meat; thirsty, and you gave me drink &amp;c</em>. Therefore doth Christ say here, <em>It is not mine to give</em>. Because he is just and will not give it to every man without respect of their deserts; yea nor alike to everyone, but diversely according to greater or lesser merits; as here St. Chrysostom maketh it plain, when our Saviour telleth them, that although they suffer martyrdom for his sake, yet he hath not to give them the two chief places. <em>See St. Jerom. upon this place, and lib. 2 adv. Jovin. ch. 15.</em> This also is a lesson for them that have to bestow Ecclesiastical benefices, that they have no carnal respect to kindred &amp;c. but to the worthiness of the persons.</p>

	<p><a id="mt20-anno-28" href="#mt20-anno-28-t" class=anno-fn-return>&uarr;</a> 28. <em>As the Son of man</em>.) Christ himself as he was the Son of man, was their and our Superior, and * Lord and Master, notwithstanding his humility, and therefore it is pride and haughtiness which is forbidden, and not Superiority or Lordship, as some Heretics would have it.</p>
