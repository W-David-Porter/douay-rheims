  <h3>OF THE FIVE FIRST BOOKS.</h3>

<div class=verse>
  <p>Moyses (so called because he was taken from the water, as the name signifieth) was born in Aegypt, the son of
    <em>Amram</em>, the son of <em>Caath</em>, the son of <em>Levi</em> the Patriarch, and so of <em>Jacob</em>, <em>Isaac</em>,
    and <em>Abraham</em>. His marvellous delivery from drowning, his education, excellent form, singular wisdom, heroic
    virtues, rare dexterity in all affairs, and whole life most admirable, are gathered out of holy Scriptures, by St.
    Gregory Bishop of Nyssa, into a brief Summary, most worthy to be read, but too large for this place. He was born
    about the year of the world two thousand four hundred, long before all profane writers, yea before many of the
    Paynime’s false Gods, as St. Augustine declareth in diverse places of his most excellent book titled <em>of the
      City of God</em>. He lived in this world 120 years: Of which 40 were in Pharao’s Court as the adopted son of
    Pharao’s daughter: forty in banishment from Aegypt in Madian: and forty more he governed the people of Israel. His
    singular praises are also briefly touched in the last chapter of Deuteronomy, added by Josue, and in the book of
    Ecclesiasticus. He died in the desert, and was buried in the vale of Moab, so secretly that no mortal man knew his
    sepulchre, lest the Jews, who were very prone to Idolatry, should have adored his body with divine honour, for the
    greatness and multitude of his miracles, and for the singular estimation they had of him for the same.
