<p><em>By the craft of the Devil speaking in a serpent, our first parents transgressed God’s commandment. (7) Who being ashamed would hide themselves: (9) but are reproved by God. (14) And besides other particular punishments (yet with promise of a Redeemer) are cast out of Paradise.</em></p>

<div class=verse>
<p>BUT <a id="gn3fna0" href="#gn3fna" class=afn>[a]</a> the serpent also was more subtle then all the beasts of the earth, which our Lord God had made. Which said to the woman: <a id="gn3-anno-1" href="#gn3-anno-1t" class="annotation">•</a> Why has God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of Paradise? <sup>2</sup>To whom the woman answered: Of the fruit of the trees that are in Paradise, we do eat: <sup>3</sup>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of paradise, God has commanded us that we should not eat: and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die. <sup>4</sup>And the serpent said to the woman: No you shall not die the death. <sup>5</sup>For God does know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>The woman therefore saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delectable to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat. <sup>7</sup>And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they <a id="gn3fnb0" href="#gn3fnb" class=afn>[b]</a> perceived themselves to be naked, they sowed together leaves of a fig-tree, and made themselves aprons.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And hearing the voice of our Lord God walking in Paradise at the afternoon air, Adam hid himself and so did his wife from the face of our Lord God, amidst the trees of Paradise. <sup>9</sup>And our Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where are you? <sup>10</sup>Who said: I heard your voice in Paradise: and I feared, because I was naked, and I hid me. <sup>11</sup>To whom he said: And who has told you that you were naked, but that you have eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you that you should not eat? <sup><sup>12</sup></sup>And Adam said: The woman, which you gave me to be my fellow-companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>And our Lord God said to the woman: Why have you done this? Who answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat. <sup>14</sup>And our Lord God said to the serpent: Because you have done this thing, <a id="gn3fnc0" href="#gn3fnc" class=afn>[c]</a> accursed are you among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon your breast shall you go, and <a id="gn3fnd0" href="#gn3fnd" class=afn>[d]</a> earth shall you eat all the days of your life. <sup><sup>15</sup></sup>I will put enmities between you and the woman, and your seed and the seed of her: <a id="gn3-anno-15" href="#gn3-anno-15t" class="annotation">•</a> she shall bruise your head in pieces, and you shall lie in wait <a id="gn3fne0" href="#gn3fne" class=afn>[e]</a> of her heel. <sup><sup>16</sup></sup>To the woman also he said: I will multiply your travails and your child-bearings: in travail shall you bring forth children, and you shall be under your husband’s power, and he shall have dominion over you. <sup><sup>17</sup></sup>And to Adam he said: Because you have heard the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you that you should not eat, cursed is the earth in your work: with <a id="gn3fnf0" href="#gn3fnf" class=afn>[f]</a> much toiling shall you eat thereof all the days of your life. <sup><sup>18</sup></sup>Thornes and thistles shall it bring forth to you, and you shall eat the herbs of the earth. <sup><sup>19</sup></sup>In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, until you return to earth, of which you were taken: because <a id="gn3-anno-19" href="#gn3-anno-19t" class="annotation">•</a> dust you are, and into dust you shall return.</p>

<p><sup><sup>20</sup></sup>And Adam called the name of his wife, Eve: for because <a id="gn3fng0" href="#gn3fng" class=afn>[g]</a> she was mother of all the living. <sup><sup>21</sup></sup>Our Lord God also made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and clothed them: <sup><sup>22</sup></sup>And said: Lo Adam is become as it were one of us, knowing good and evil: now therefore <a id="gn3-anno-22" href="#gn3-anno-22t" class="annotation">•</a> lest perhaps he reach forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. <sup><sup>23</sup></sup>And our Lord God sent him out of the Paradise of pleasure, to work the earth of which he was taken. <sup>24</sup>And he cast out Adam, and <a id="gn3-anno-24" href="#gn3-anno-24t" class="annotation">•</a> placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubins, and a flaming and a turning sword, for to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

<h4>ANNOTATIONS. CHAP. 3.</h4>
<p><a id="gn3-anno-1t" href="#gn3-anno-1" class=anno-fn-return>1. </a> <em>Why has God?</em>.) Here we may see how sin came first amongst men. For the devil envying man’s happy state tempted Eve the weaker person, beginning with a question, thereby to allure her into conference, and by such a question as might bring her into suspicion of God’s affection towards man, saying: <em>Why has God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of Paradise?</em> insinuating by these words, and withal internally suggesting, that God dealt hardly with them, abridging their liberty without cause. And when he had got so much of her, that she was displeased with the precept, which she showed by adding of her own (to make it seem more grievous) that they were forbidden <em>to touch the tree</em>, and again by reporting the punishment as doubtful, saying: <em>Lest perhaps we die</em>; then the tempter avouched boldly, and falsely, that they should not die, and charged God to be envious of the benefit they should get by eating of that tree, saying <em>their eyes should be opened, and they should be as Gods, knowing good and evil</em>. Upon which persuasion, and liking also she had to the fruit, she did take and eat, and persuaded Adam also to eat. And forthwith they saw that they would not have seen, knew evil which they had better not to have known, were ashamed, and endeavoured to cover and hide themselves. Even thus the devil deals with men ever since, assaulting the weaker persons, and weaker part, as the flesh and sensuality, and by them sets upon the stronger and superior part, to get consent of free will, without which there is no sin; according to that famous saying of St. Augustin: <em>Pecatum adeo est voluntarium, ut nullo modo sit peccatum, si non voluntarium. Sin is so voluntary, that in no wise it can be sin, if it be not voluntary</em>. Wherefore it was no sin in Eve to be tempted by the serpent, which she could not avoid, nor in Adam to be tempted by Eve, but they sinned when they consented to the evil suggestions. And now in the regenerate, though concupiscence remain, which is the effect of sin past, and occasion of sin in those that yield again to temptations, yet is it not sin, but punishment of sin, and matter of exercise in the just, and if we resist, of merit: and therefore St. Paul exhorts us, <em>to walk in the spirit, and the lusts of the flesh we shall not accomplish</em>. And in another place shows, <em>that he which fights lawfully, shall be crowned</em>.<p>

<p><a id="gn3-anno-15t" href="#gn3-anno-15" class=anno-fn-return>15. </a> <em>She shall bruise</em>.) Protestants will not admit this reading, <em>ipsa conterets</em>, she shall bruise, lest our Blessed Lady should be said any way to bruise the serpent’s head. And Kemnisius amongst others says, that all ancient Fathers read, <em>ipsum</em>, not, <em>ipsa</em>. But he is convinced of lying by Claudius Marius Victor, <em>lib. 1. in Gen., Alcimus Auitus lib. 3. carm. ch. 6.</em>, St. Chrysostom, <em>hom. 17. in Genes.</em>, St. Ambrose <em>lib de fuga saeculi cap. 7.</em>, St. Augustin, <em>li. 2. de Genesi contra Manichaeos, cap. 18. & lib. 11. de Genesi ad literam chap. 26.</em>, St. Gregory, <em>lib. 1. Moralium cap. 38</em>. And after them St. Bede, Eucherius, Rabanus, Rupertus, Strabus, and Lyra upon this place, St. Bernard, <em>ser 2. super Missus est.</em> And many others, who read <em>ipsa</em> as the Latin text now has.</p>

<p>But whether we read, <em>She shall bruise</em>, or, <em>her seed</em>, that is her son Christ, <em>shall bruise</em> the serpent’s head, we attribute no more, nor no less to Christ nor to our Lady by the one reading, than by the other: for by the text, <em>I will put enmities between you and the woman, between your seed and her seed</em>, it is clear, that this enmity and battle pertained to the woman and her seed on the one party, and to this devil, that spoke by the serpent, and all the wicked, on the other party, and that the victory should happen to mankind. Which being captive by Adam’s sin, occasioned by a woman, should be redeemed, both sexes, though in far different sort, concurring thereto. And so it is most true, that Christ by his own proper power, and his Blessed Mother by her most immediate cooperating to his Incarnation (and consequently to other Mysteries) did bruise the serpent’s head, break and vanquish his power. * As many ancient Fathers do excellently discourse: namely St. Bernard, writing upon these words in the Apocalypse ch. 12, <em>A great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun</em>: Even though (says he) by one man and one woman we were greatly damaged, yet (God be thanked) by one man and one woman all losses are repaired, and that not without great increase of graces. For the benefit does far exceed the loss. Our merciful father giving us for a terrestrial Adam Christ our Redeemer, and for old Eve God’s own Mother. † Moreover as the same St. Bernard shows, this blessed Virgin in singular sort bruised the serpent’s head, in that she quite vanquished all manner suggestions of the wicked serpent, never yielding to, nor taking delight in any evil moved by him.</p>

<p><a id="gn3-anno-19t" href="#gn3-anno-19" class=anno-fn-return>19. </a> <em>Dust you are</em>.) By these words Adam was admonished to humble himself, considering the matter whereof his body was made, and into which he should be resolved again. * Whereupon it came to be a ceremony amongst penitents, to cast ashes on their heads, as appears in holy Scriptures. For which cause the Church now also uses this ceremony the first day of Lent, putting ashes on her children’s heads: willing them to remember, that dust they are, and to dust they shall return, to move us by this meditation to more serious penance.</p>

<p><a id="gn3-anno-22t" href="#gn3-anno-22" class=anno-fn-return>22. </a> <em>Lest perhaps</em>.) Notwithstanding God’s eternal decree in disposing all things, and his omnipotence which nothing can resist, yet he produces good, and either avoids or disposes of evil which he suffers, by ordinary means, as appears <em>Act. 27:31</em>, and that because man has free-will, with which God concurs, and destroys not nor forces, as St. Augustin teaches.</p>

<p><a id="gn3-anno-24t" href="#gn3-anno-24" class=anno-fn-return>24. </a> <em>Placed Cherubins</em>.) Man being cast out of Paradise, the same is defended with double guard: with Angels, that are watchful, wise, and potent; and with fire and sword, most terrible armour to man. Whereby again we see that God uses ordinary means in his providence, as the ministry of Angels and human terror, and would neither destroy the tree, nor deprive it of the virtue to prolong life, nor bereave man of free-will, by which he might desire to return: but conserving nature in all creatures, prevents inconveniences otherwise.</p>

<p>These Angels also hinder the devil, that he can not enter Paradise, lest he should take of the fruit of the tree, and give it to men to prolong their lives, and thereby draw them to his service.</p>
